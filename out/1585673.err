Hi, so my mom s been experiencing an aching from her right leg and it kinda has bruises (it doesn t really have the same color of the typical bruise you know, but to the spot where it aches and we can clearly see that her right leg s way bigger than the other, so it has a huge dark spot on that area I don t really know what is it called) so anyway, she s been experiencing it for almost a year now. Before, my went to the doctor she was recommended to go to the dermatologist. When she went there, they just gave her creams and some anti-inflammatory lotions which doesn t work on her. Then after that, she went to another doctor (it was her co-worker, my mom worked in a hospital as a Nursing Attendant btw) so she asked her co-worker if she could do a biopsy on her leg. But the doctor said she couldn t, not unless she undergo MRI testing first to know which part should she do the procedure. So a week after that, my mom went to the other hospital (this hospital is private and a well known hospital in our town) so after a week, she got the result. They told her that it was only a thickening of the leg muscles and that her veins on her leg (right This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

I have a degenrated disc at my L4/L5 level. It is at about 25% degeneration. My L5/S1 also has some slight degenration. I found out after pulling a muscle in my back 4 years ago. My right leg is about a centimeter shorter than my left, which is the main cause of the degeneration. I have shoe inserts which leveled my hips and legs. I recently pulled a muscle in my lower back. I have been experiencing lower back pain and stiffness, along with sciatic pain. I have also been experiencing intermittent pain in my left testicle. It comes and goes and sometimes moves to the right testicle. I have also noticed a frequent urge to urinate. I have noticed that not as much urine comes out and I still feel like I have to go shortly thereafter. If I massage the area near the rectum and behind the scrotum, it provides relief. Movement also provides some relief. The pain moves around between the testicles and base of the penis. Sometimes it disappears completely. I have not been tested for an STI, mainly because I have been married for over 5 years and have no other sexual partners. There have also been no physical signs, i.e. discharge, burning/pain while urinating, cloudy or smelly urine This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

My husband was on hemodialysis for about a year.  Last December we began with peritoneal dialysis at home and have been doing this for almost a year.  He had his catheter moved last June as it was much too low.  Since then he has been retaining fluid in his abdomen.  He recently had a CAT scan and a ecocardiogram which showed a heart problem which his doctor said could be controlled with medication.  While in the hospital, his blood pressure dropped so low he was given a bag of saline solution which raised it but he was taken off this medication for his heart.  Now he is at home and has a physical therapist come to our home twice a week and he is doing light exercises but his biggest problem, which has been with him for about three months, is shortness of breath.  It is from all of the fluid in his abdomen pressing on his diaphram, etc.  He has increased his trouser size by two inches.  I called this to the attention of his nephrologist as his stomach is like a big bowl of jelly.  Nothing is being done to take care of this fluid except the doctor has put him back on hemodialysis with no reduction of fluid.  Is there a possibility that there is a leak inside from his catheter or could it be a buildup of fluids from This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

I have a high family history of heart and stroke disease. I have been taking Vitoran for almost three years for high colestoral, It is now under 175 with a ratio of 3 to 5. When the symptoms started I had an EKG, stress test and stress echo. These have all been normal. I even had a heart cath, which showed a 30% narrowing of my anterior desending coronary artery and a couple of lesser narrowings in two other vessels. I take paxil (20mg) a day for depression.

Hi, I m a female aged 29. About 6 weeks ago I got a really intense pain that comes in waves at the top of my stomach. The pain is so bad and on the same pain scale as contractions, only higher up between my ribs. Within the 6 weeks I ve had this pain on 3 seperate occasions and each time it s been followed by dirrahrea. It usually lasts about 2 days. 4 weeks ago I took a really sharp pain in behind my rib on my right side that went up into my right shoulder. The pain came on me very quickly and I couldn t lie down or take deep breaths as the pain was so bad, I was so worried I went to a&e, on arrival I had a high temp, pulse over 100 and low blood pressure. Doctor did an X-ray whicChatDoctore back clear, and done a ct scan as they suspected PE, this also came back clear. They told me my bloods came back that I had infection somewhere but they just didn t know where and sent me home with antibiotics. 4 days later I went back as I didn t feel 1 bit better, done another X-ray which was clear, more bloods and tested my liver this time as they were thinkin maybe gallbladder, al bloods came back clear, my This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Hello.I am 44 years old, and I am a seaman. Very often I was exposed to stressful situation, until about a year ago I had panic attack. I was feeling very scared when I was alone, thinking that I am going to die, I could not sleep in my bed because of some fear. If i have slept 2 hours I was awaking in panic and fear. Could not stay alone, could not concentrate on my job, constantly having bad thoughts passing through my mind. I have visited doctor who gave me Deanxit tablets, and after first one i felt amazingly better, only i had trouble sleeping. I was taking two tablets per day for about a month, than I signed off from the ship and stop with Deanxit. During vacation I have visited psychiatrist, explained what happened to me, and he told me that I have suffered panic attack. My psychiatrist has prescribed me SEROXAT - Paroxetin tablets, 20 mg, if happens againAfter two months at home, where everything was ok, only trouble sleeping from time to time, I have signed on another ship, and situation has started but not that strong as before.I have started taking Seroxat and everything was ok, only trouble sleeping again, and I have been taking Seroxat for full 4 months while I was on board the ship.

Ive been in hospital twice during the last 3 weeks... first they thought it was galstones or blood clot through my lung.  It started with pain in my lower back... felt like the start of labour... then it moved to the front over my liver and I had some stabbing pain too.... the to just below my sternum (very sore when I breath in ).... then I also had pain in my right shoulder and up the right ride of my neck. They could not find blood clots or galstones.... my bloods seemed normal except for CRP 92 and D-dimer 663 and after the third test they told me my liver function was slightly off...Bili 12, ALP102,GGT43,ALT61, CRP 11. By week two the pain was much less and they send me home with antibiotics.  Now another week on.... I feel like something get stuck under my ribs - feels like when a baby pushes with his feet against it (not sore, but pressure).... I also get a feeling of movement in my stomach from time to time... again like when you are pregnant... I am not!!!  Had my period a week ago.... and I am 46.

I have a DVT factor 8, had this condition for 11 years. I have had pressure in my chest. I have a greenfeather filter. Today I went to the emergency room. They did test and stated after testing INR result was 0.97 low. No clots. They upped my coumadin after being on only 2.5 to 5.0. That was Wednesday. MY INR has not raised, I am worried about why it has not raised. I was sent home told to contact my doctor on Monday. Nothing was given to me to raise it. They did cat scan and testing and found nothing including a blood clot. I have been on 2.5 Mg. for a year. I have not had my INR checked until two weeks ago because the doctor I use to have said it was ok for six months to not have it checked. My new primary said that was not correct. Two week s ago I had a blood clot that the filter did catch. Was taken to Freeman Hospital where they did test, and even a echo of my heart, while doing a stress test. They said it was heart burn!!!! My primary said that was ridiculous that it sounded like I had passed a clot that the filter did catch. Never had this close of a call.

we were told our child may have abdominal migraines- both of this parents have regular migraines( headaches) and strong family history of headache migraines on both maternal and paternal sides.  One family member ( adult) has abdominal migraines.  Our child has what appears to be very strong episodes of nausea that can last for as long as six hours but usually around 1 to two hours.  nausea is in waves.  He gets extremely pale and says his cheeks feel numb and then sometimes his hands and arms do as well.. this can last as long as nausea sometimes.. I thought the tingling sensations might be panic related ( panics when the nausea is very bad) but GI doc said tingling should not last that long with panic.  He also has dark circles often with these and more recently has complained of back bothering him when he has these episodes.  He has had stomach cramping for two months now as well as the nausea but nausea is getting more severe... he had upper and lower scoping done and has been recently diagnosed with acid reflux for which he is taking 40 mg of prilosec in capsule form ( capsules poured out).  He has also been prescribed ondansetron for nausea ( which does not always seem real effective) also just started him on amitript This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

I developed a cough in December followed a few days later by cold symptoms. Chest pain and coughing up mucus so went to the doctor who said i had pharyngitis. 2 weeks after and still coughing i developed really sore ribs especially when laughing, coughing, sneezing deep breathing and lying down in bed. Went to the doctor who said it was the intercostal muscles and gave me pain relief and an inhaler due to shortness of breath. 2 weeks later due to not breathing properly i developed a chest infection given anti biotics. After a month of pain relief and still not much relief she wondered whether the pain relief (diclofenac) was causing reflux making the cough worse so prescribed some tablets to go along with it. The night time cough did disappear. Rib pain is still present when deep breathing especially when exercising. A week ago i really overdone it strenously walking and then 3 days ago developed a cough, that is progressivley getting worse. Last night it caused throat pain whilst coughing and a feeling of a lump in my throat and struggling to breathe took my inhaler and it actually relieved it all. Rib pain is now alot worse again and this is 14 weeks since the illness started. I dont understand why the rib pain hasnt gone and why this cough keeps reoccurring This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Hello, my name is Davie. I have severe back and neck problems, have for close to a decade. My entire spine and neck is very sore, nerve problems and no doubt my spine would be out in lots of places. A few weeks ago i started getting pains in my throat, like pain coming from the top of my chest just below my collar bones and traveling up my two neck two arteries. It isnt constant, but is there daily and comes and goes. Its in direct line with where the worst part of my back is, just below my collarbone line. That level is where my back is just beyond sore, words cant describe how bad it gets and i know my spine is out of place badly there. Now at the front at the exact same level is where im getting the pains from that are shooting into my throat. I know that pains like that can be heart related, but i feel fine apart from my back pain, my heart feels okay. Im just wondering can severe back pain and having a spine out of place cause such problems like this at the front. It just feels very tight and i get shooting pains going into my throat, but theres no real trouble breathing, just the usual tightness i feel with my spine being out and being very painful.

Hello! Doctor, I ve been undergoing Psychiatric treatment since 2007 for the diagnosed Acute Depreciation & Anxiety. I m being treated with Ventab DXT 25, Macorate CR200, Wacalert 50 & Zapiz 1.00 whenever I feel more anxiety or seem not able to control my thoughts. Actually, this started in 1998 from Exam Phobia & was treated for same. Since then I ve been in & out on medication from time to time till 2007 from where there s consistency in medication & follow ups. Sutre, the treatment has helped me to stabilize over the period. I ve got married, have a small daughter, completed post graduation, MBA & also did certification in SAP FI. The doctor has been of great help to me. He was of opinion that I ve lesser coping capacity. And, that s not entirely wrong. His major concern has been my changing the job & settling in it. He s slowly started reducing power of drugs with powers mentioned above. But, it seems I ve developed dependency on these medicines. And, I want to stand on my own with my thought controlling me rather than medicines. In this blog, I read in answer to one patient, reference to Meditation, Self Motivation.

my daughter, 15 months old (9.1 kg), is suffering from high temp. fever ranging from 102 deg F to 106 deg F since last 5 days. Her doctor prescribed Syp. Meftal-P & Syp. Maxtra-P each 5 ml/3 times a day. After 3 days with these two medicines, fever exists same. Usually, the fever comes 7 hours after medicine. Now, yesterday, I went to another child specialist and as per him, its typhoid. This doc suggested for some blood & urine tests and along with that also prescribed Syp. Ziprax-100 (3 ml, twice a day for 10 days), Ibugesic Plus (4.5ml, 4 times a day, SOS/fever). When they tried to take blood sample from by baby in the lab, they failed as my daughter is very naughty and also crying too much. what so ever, after this crying/trying event, doc also suggested to try with Ziprax-100 as per prescription and revisit to doc after 3 days. So far, the Ziprax-100 is given to my baby 3 times i.e. yesterday at 11am, 10pm and today 10am.

right shoulder problemHello Doctor. I injured my shoulder two days ago while wrestling with my cousin. I was in a head lock underneath him when he decided to trip me and bring me to the ground. When we fell, all of his body weight landed on my right shoulder and I instantly felt a swelling sensation. I was still able to movw my arm afterwards but as the shouldwr cooled down it made it impossible for me to move it without assistance. Aboit a year ago I was playing football and threw a ball against the wind. When I did that I felt a small pop in the middle/center parr of my shoulder. I did see a therapist for it and had it fixed. This pain is similar but more intense. My shoulder is not poped out but my rotation is very limited. I have to assist my right arm even when I am laying down. Whether its putting my arm on my stomach or above me it still needs assistance. Whenever I feel I want to move my arm anywhere, I feel I have to battle a tweak inside my shoulder. Would this be a rotater cuff injury or just some swelling that isnt allowing my arm to move yet? I fell like something needs to pop back into place but only slightly. Im told that that feeling is because of the swelling. It also hurts to get up and This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

I am a 62yr. old female diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer in 2006. Metastases was to the liver, omentum, lining of the pelvic floor, and 3 out of 15 lymph nodes, along with the colon. I have had a colon resection and aggressive chemo then remained on maintenance chemo until 2009 when I had a recurrence in the right ovary. I had a hysterectomy and another 6month regimen of chemo. Since that time I have been on maintenance chemo. Had a surgery to remove extensive scar tissue and part of the small bowel due to freq. bowel obstructions. My only symptoms of gluten intolerance could also be due to the chemo so I m wondering if I have some intolerance. I do get some discomfort after eating, had freq. constipation until I began taking probiotics and sometimes Metamucil. I now have a ventral hernia and don t have as much constipation. Now I have lower left quadrant pain off and on. The Pet Scan showed something in the colon but the colonoscopy showed nothing. My CT Scan showed small lesions on my liver and kidney which are too small to determine what they are. I already had some cysts on my liver and kidneys but these are new.

HI At my last appointment with my heart specialist the doctor increased my dose of Carvidilol (Coureg) to 12.5mg twice per day in the hope that this would decrease the chances of an AFIB event, in fact he said I can eat anything now. Unfortunately over Christmas I had two or three AFIB events each of which subsided after a few hours and where my pulse fortunately never reached over 124 ppm ( at least when I checked it ). The reason for the events was probably due to over indulgence in foods that may have had higher levels of sodium chloride at the same time as drinking a lot of wine and on one occasion brandy. On a normal day my pulse is 49 to 52 in the morning and seldom gets above 65 even after some fairly heavy physical activity. It does go up to mid to high 60 s if I have two or three glasses of wine. Normally of course I am on a very low salt diet as my wife and I make almost everything from scratch ourselves without adding sodium chloride. The reason I am writing is that early March we are traveling to Australia for a month followed by a month cruising back to the US. I don t know whether I will be able to get low or no salt food on board the ship. I m wondering whether an even higher dose of coureg might This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Last night I was at a party with no available restroom. I had been drinking, so I had to go really bad, but I held it until I got home. I ran straight to bathroom, sat down and started to go, I went a lot at first, then suddenly without warning it completely stopped midstream. I still had the urge to urinate, and my bladder still felt very full, and I was experiencing some burning. I tried pushing but could not get a single drop out. When I wiped with the tissue I felt something hard, I was mortified to feel a kidney stone lodged in my urethra! Part of it was sticking out, I could grab it with my fingernails, but I couldn t pull it out. I spent nearly 2 hours wiggling it, pulling it, pushing it, trying to turn it but it was stuck. Finally it came out, and I was able to void my bladder, and I m feeling fine. I had no warning, I m familiar with kidney stones, I ve passed many before, the biggest bring 8mm. Those always caused me excruciating pain, but this one did not. All day I was wearing a tight corset as part of my Halloween costume, maybe I was compressed so tight I didn t feel it?

I figured the pain would present the next day in my leg or tail bone but to my surprise the pain was very mild in my leg and there was no pain in bottom at all. I noticed two days later my side was hurting with a mild to moderate pain. The pain is located exactly in a certain spot up under my rib cage on my right side. If I put any kind of pressure or even slightly push it the pain goes from a 3 to a 10! It hurts so bad that even scream out loud after I push it. It does not hurt when I breathe nor when I walk. I can feel it but not to the point where I can t do anything. I cant sleep on my right side without feeling the pain because of the pressure to my side. I can t even lean up against my counter top while in the kitchen.

My medical aid has rejected a claim for a incisional hernia, stating that the 3 previous operations were the problem and that these procedures were not covered by medical aid. The first procedure was 25 years ago it was a gastric bypass at age 15, I had no problems until 5 years ago and a doctor convinced me that if I dont change the JIB procedure to a RNY that my life expectancy will be shortened by 20 years but I was very healthy and BMI of 20, he lied to the medical company and they paid for a gastrectomy, I started gaining weight and went to go see another doctor for advise and he just wanted to operate, he said that the previous doctor made a mess, I trusted this doctor and had to pay out of my own pocket because of my low BMI but didnt want to gain all the weight back and he reassured me that I would look fantastic. But this was not the case, this operation only made me gain more weight and I had constant pain. When I went back several times to show him the stomach is pertruding when i lift my neck his reply was that his does the same. What am I to do?

hI, I have no question for you. Just an attitude as to how pain management is being, or should I say not being done. Because of a handful of people who CHOOSE TO Abuse drugs, who really gets punished? Spinal Stenosis and 2 back surgeries, the last the titanium rods, plates, and screws were inserted from L2 thru L5. Stopped the pain for about 2 years, or at least at a tolerable level. Then Lortabs helped. Sent to pain clinic for epidurals. Epidurals on me were extremely painful. Scale of 1-10 they were a 20. (Not Kidding) Quality of life was going fast. couldn t do or go because the pain had grown to the point that I couldn t eat or sleep. Pain was 24 hours a day. Told by the pain Dr. to stay on the Lortab and come to the pain clinic every 4 or 5 weeks for epidurals. Epidurals were not only painful but I got very little relief if any from them. Finally PCP started me on oxycontin and Fentynal patch. I was much better for awile. I was taught that in so called pain management you would gradually increase dose until you knew the patient was experiencing some quality of life.

Also my blood work came back that I have good liver function, kidneys, and etc. Does this mean I have some kind of liver damage in areas of my liver? Since I dont drink anymore will my liver get better? What can I do or take to help my liver and entire body get back in shape and back to being healthier again?

Dear Doctor, Alcohol, Atrial Fibrillation & Life after... I get blotted, noxious after drinking only one glass of white wine. Although I do not drink much, I ve had a couple episodes of atrial fibrillation in the past 2 to 3 years. These episodes were serious enough for me to be kept in the ICU of the hospitals I went to. Both lasted for 48 hours+ followed by a couple of days of watch time. Ever since the second episodes, I was prescribed to take Rytmonorm 150 coupled with Coraspin 300 to avoid any blood clots. After 2 years on the treatment, I ve hoped that my heart would be clear of the problem and tried to get off of the medicine. Within 24 hours, my heart started to beat erratically, enough so that I immediately reached for the pills... Along with my heart beating awkwardly, I ve noticed an almost instant pain in my head coupled with a slight but persistent confusion... I have repeatedly told about the combination of effects to a few doctors only to be dismissed at once as there doesn t seem to be any correlation with the heart/brain (as per the doc s opinions)... I have gotten a check-up with my cardiologist a couple of weeks ago and he recommends that I stay on the medication (one of my valve (top?) This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

My legs hurt right down through the bone and it feels like ther are 10thousand pin pricks coming out. at one point there was purpura and bleeding and severe bruising. No one can figure this out. The Dermatologist just wants to sell me elixers and free and clear shampoo. First the said vascullitis then a  reaction to bug bits then  today eczema. I am not buying it.. I also have little bumps that grow into what almost looks like a chicken pock mark. This is on my arms. I have been running fevers and having chills.

Hi doctor, hope you can help me with this. Yesterday morning (about 28 hours ago), I woke up with a morning erection, then decided to masturbate, even though my bladder must have been quite full, or at least half full. I usually masturbate after I have been to the toilet. The masturbation was quite short lasting, lying on my back, quite gentle masturbation, not rough, but at the ejaculation point, it didn t feel very good, a little painful during, which I haven t experienced before. I think it must have been related to the bladder not being emptied first. A few minutes later, I possibly made a second mistake, by urinating. It did seem like the urethrea was not ready for urine yet, took a while to succeed. Is it advised to wait a while before one urinates? Then during the day and night I have felt rather uncomfortable, mostly during the night, some pain/discomfort, which feels like it is located at the point where I usually feel if I need to urinate or not. Is this bladder pain? It helps a bit to urinate though. Could I have had some urine in the urethrea accidentally mixed together with the sperm during ejaculation? And is this harmful? I also wanna mention that the This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.

Hi there, I wanted to know if I could get some information about my back issue. I am a 49 year old woman in fairly good health. I am 5 9 tall and weigh 195 lbs. In the past year I have changed my lifestyle and have lost over 50 lbs. In the fall of 1994 my L4-5 disc bulged/hernitated and it also affected my right side sciatic nerve. After a hospital stay and 6 months of physio my back was not getting any better. I eventually had to have surgery. I had a discetomy and the L4-4 level and a limited laminectomy posteriorly at this operative site as well. My back seemed better for a few years then started to act up again. In 2002 I had an MRI done and the diagnosis stated theat there was a generalized bulging of the reamaining intervertebral disc at the L4-5 level without evidence of focality. Also, it stated that at the L4-5 level the posterior facet joints demonstrate very early mild symmetric degenerative change. Again, I took things easy, had physio and things seemed to be ok. Fast forward to 2011 and again I am in pain and limited mobility. My days are the worse in the mornings and in the evenings.

Could I have some other type of infection? or could costo cause swollen lymph nodes? Also, this pain is pretty much a constant, however sometimes it s better/worse. if i stretch, pull, reach, turn wrong it goes right back to hurting again. i have a 1 yr old so it s hard to do NOTHING and rest it.

my son who is 9 years old has been complaining about stomach aches. This started three weeks ago after he got braces. We gave him tylenol for a couple days after the braces were put on as he was in significant pain. We stopped the tylenol after two days. About three days later he ended up constipated and had significant stomach pain. we had him checked out by a doctor and he was constipated. Over about a week his constipation seemed to be the cause of cramping and stomach pain. It took about four or five days for the constipation to subside and he had pains persistently over those days. He slept fine at night but he complained of pain mysteriously when it was time for school. He ended up missing a week of school. Last week he made it to school but a couple evenings he complained a couple times about stomach pain but he made it to school and seemed to function ok. He had a coupe episodes in the past three days complaining about stomach pain but wehad him lay down a few minutes and he would seem to be fine. Now tonight he complained significantly about stomach pain again crying. This was over about a three hour period and then it subsided tonight right before bedtime. He continues to sleep through the night without episodes. Any thoughts<|endoftext|>

Yes, I have been having some watery red spotting after I wipe when I go pee pee.  I have been the the doctor three times and I gave them a urine specimen.  The first time, doctor diagnosed me with a UTI, but wasnt sure if it could also be a yeast infection.  So, she prescribed Bacterim for 5 days but it gave me diahhrea so Dr. changed it to Cipro, which worked fine.  She also gave me a one time pill to take for the yeast infection after finishing the Cipro.  I took all my medication.  During treatment, I saw a little spotting of watered down blood after wiping my pee pee.  Dr. took another urine exam.  Said I never had UTI but that I definitely had a yeast infection.  I finished all my meds so I waited to see if I would be okay and it seemed as though I was.  Yesterday, when I went pee pee, I wiped and saw some more watered down red spots on the tissue.  I returned to the Dr. today who ordered a urinalysis.  He is having me worked up for bladder or kidney cancer just as a precaution. Still dont know what is causing the sporadic blood spots.

Hi,I am concurned about my boyfriend John. He is 16 years old and I fear he may be undiagnosed bipolar. Ive researched online and I am almost convinced but i think i need an expert opinion.He suffers from extream depression and has terrible mood swings that can occur at almost any time. Ive had to talk him down from a suicide attempt twice in the last 3 to 4 months.He feels extreamly agitated and hopless, and is constantly anxious. He has what looks like panic attacks and he is also has trouble sleeping most nights.His anger causes him to act out and snap and yell at people. Earlier this month he flipped off the dean to our school! His behavior is unpredictable and quite scary.He used to cut and burn himself, but ive managed to get him to stop that, and he still occasionally abuses Marijunana, but not as much as he did at one point.his parents are in the dark about his problems and are not very involved with him. Hes afraid to confront them about anything, because they do not see eye to eye. Im concurned and frightened, but I am also, only 16(almost 17). What can he do and what can I do as his girlfriend and best friend to help him?Thank you,Mariah<|endoftext|> This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

why do doctors  do ex rays or ct scan  for one thing and discover a dark spot on the kidney by accident and say dont worry its nothing and 2 years of bleeding pain pullups and other stuff then just to discover that when the patient questioned the doctor before was ignored and now diagnose with kidney cancer which could have been cured 2 years earlier tell me that answer  hey why doctors play god and think were all dumb and how dare we question you guys. you may of went to school for this but does not mean you know everything.For example fen fen was a diuretic  used for obese people but it took 50 years for doctors to fess up it destroyed hart vales  why is that hey why you may think this may not be for you to answer but this applies to all doctors for all  things also the cure for cancer if cancer is in all of us and some get it others dont its not an off switch its whats missing in the body it is like the game kerplunk   pull  too many sticks out it all falls apart leave them  all in nothing happens. Its an enzyme people loose  radiation and chemotherapy talk about  old school do a study on what each cancer patient is missing sometimes it does not have to do anything it just has to be their to keep the rest in place .

I was first diagnosed with borderline ectasia of the ascending aorta at 3.6 cm back in 2010 via CT scan. In 2011 it grew to 3.8 cm via CT Scan. In 2012 it grew to 4.0 cm on CT and it was reported as 3.8 cm with echocardiogram done by cardio surgeon. It was determined that with me having so many CT scans for other medical conditions that they observe the ascending aorta via echocardiogram because of concern of developing radiation from recurrent CT scan. In 2013 the ascending aorta was at 4.0 according to echocardiogram done by cardio surgeon. Just recently as three weeks ago my primary sent me over to a cardiologist as opposed to the cardio surgeon on March of 2014 (this month). Cardiologist did echo and said it was 3.8 cm and that it was barely dialated and that even if there was concern that consideration for surgery could be done only at 5.0 cm or larger. He did say, however, that he d like to see me in 6 months for follow up. This is concerning to me as there is conflicting info from this recent echo from the cardiologist (claiming it was 3.8 cm) and the echo that was done by the cardio surgeon back in august of 2013 which was reported at 4.0.

I started working at a Wastewater Treatment Plant 4 months ago. Around a month and a half ago, a piece of wire that was in influent wastewater stuck my finger through my latex gloves. Our treatment plant handles wastewater from the local prison. Around 3 weeks ago I started having pain in my right side. I thought it was from shoveling. I havent been shoveling since then, and the pain continued and now has expanded from the right side to the right front of my abdomen just below my ribcage. It is tender when I push below my ribs and it feels like something is pushing on everything around that area. I started with what I thought was a chest cold a week and a half ago, and now I started in with hives head to toe 4 days ago. Ive kept the hives down somewhat with Benadryl, but I have a huge loss of energy, still rattly cough, and the swelling (which I believe is my liver) hasnt gone down at all. My worry is that I may have contracted Hepatitis or some other form of disease/parasite from work. Ive looked a lot online, and it looks like I have 90% of the HepA symptoms but am not jaundiced.

I spent the night at my Aunt and Uncles house the other night with my daughter. Around midnight my feet started to itch. I went to lay down for bed with my daughter, and after maybe 30 minutes I woke up itching on my legs. I thought maybe it was just my pants so I took them off. Then maybe 5 minutes later my torso also began to itch, so I took my shirt off. Maybe 10 minutes later my entire body was itching so bad I couldn t get a bit of sleep. I laid down on the couch thinking perhaps it was just the bed, and needless to say, I didn t sleep at all. The itching didn t let up for 6 hours. I took a shower which made me feel a little better. I managed to get an hour of sleep before I woke up itching again. I didn t get any rash or bumps until about 1pm today. I have been itching nonstop since midnight the night before last. The weals were on my legs and very large. Covered my entire thighs. They were there for about 2 hours, at least. When I got home from work at 6 they were gone. I then got weals on the bottoms of my feet, and on my hands. I finally got them to ease up after about 2 hours This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Alright, so I m going to be brutally honest because I really, really want to figure out what is going on. Recently, after a couple weeks of heavy restricting (I m an anorectic), I d gotten down to my lowest weight at this height (BMI of 18.6) and then I binged one day, the total was about 800-900 calories but I exercised about 600 off, so I wasn t too worried about getting back on track. I heavily restricted the day after that (two days ago) and I found I had gained 2lb. I was trying not to freak out but ended up binging, which brought that day s total to about 1500. All day (pre-binge) I d been having these strange stomach pains that weren t like normal hunger pangs. It was dull ache that began to get worse and worse, like nothing I d ever felt before. In an attempt to calm myself down after my binge I told myself that those pains would probably go away.....AND I took some Laxatives. And by some I mean 3 when the recommended dosage is 2. Normally when I take laxatives they take 6hrs to take effect and then my bowels release heavily about three times. It s uncomfortable only right before I, er, poo and then it This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.

OK, so the other day i lifted a pallet while working at walmart. I liftted the pallet with my right side while using my right hand while my left hand was supporting it. I lifted with the right side of my body. All of a sudden i felt a sharp pain in my lower left abdomen and so i slowly put the pallet down and walked to the restroom to see what was up. I just felt a pulsing pain  and went back to the salesfloor walking and i would feel a pulsing pain everytime i would walk with my left leg. The pulsing pain was in my lower left abdomen. It is in the same spot that months a go i went to the doctor for. I went to the doctor for pain in my lower left abdomen. He felt around and didnt feel a hernia or tell me that i had any symptoms, i also gave a blood test because i let him know that i had a puppy that died from parasites and that maybe they could of spread to me and got in my lower left abdomen hence the blood test. Now it has slowly gone down (the pulsing pain) and doesnt really hurt because it is not pulsing but a more every once in a while throughout the day and it is more uncomfortable than pain.Obviously if i lift something that takes a bit This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Hi there,Im a 21 year old male and I have a few symptoms that I cant get out of my headI have a small lump in my left breast and have had it for about 3 years. It hasnt gotten any bigger and Ive had an ultrasound done on it that came back showing it to be non-cancerous.  I also have an enlarged lymph node in my neck/throat just below my jaw line, only on the right side that sometimes swells up and sometimes is normal, but Ive had this too for about 3 years.In about the past year Ive developed a pain in my right shoulder, 99% of the things that I do in my everyday life dont effect it at all.  But I can feel like its slightly swollen/enlarged compared to my left shoulder.  When I raise my right arm above my head like Im pointing to the sky and bring it back down slowly and to the side my shoulder cracks, every single time that I do that motion.Recently, in about the past month Ive started to get a tightness in my chest, almost exclusively associated to the days after I consume alcohol but not only on those days.  Im constantly thinking about these symptoms and second-guessing the ultrasound results.  Cancer is in the forefront of my mind whenever I start This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

I am a 33 year old female I weigh 139 and Im 53 i had a baby 3 months ago. Was completely healthy while pregnant and no blood pressure issues at all. Over the past several weeks I have been really worried about my health and it has stressed me out badly. Started taking zoloft 25 mg for anxiety at night. Last week I had blood work done because I have been getting light headed and very tired. My blood counts were good and no thyroid issue, sugar and iron were fine. They found a trace of protein and blood in urine and chalked it up to a UTI. Also had elevated liver enzymes of Alt was 98 and ast was 51. Cholesterol was 262 with LDL being 179, hdl being 74, and triglycerides being 54. My blood pressure at the doctors office was 124/90 while sitting, 117/79 while laying down and 177/81 while standing. I was very nervous an attributed that to the readings. Since then, I have been so worried about the elevated enzymes that it has caused me to stress. The other liver function test they did was normal and i didnt test positive for hepitits. Today my blood pressure was 134/100 and 2 minutes later it was 117/76. Im afraid my cuff may be going bad or something because how could it go down so fast?? Im This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

My brother began acting strange about 6 years ago. It started out with him thinking that people were after him and has progressed so much that he is completely antisocial, doesnt work, he has been Baker Acted 2 times for a suicidal threat and attempt, he thinks the government is after him, thinks there are speakers hidden in his furniture, we have caught him chanting (not in any real language) and writing strange non-sensical notes. He has false memories of when we were children. He believes doctors are trying to control him and drug him. Our family has tried to get him to seek therapy and/or drug treatment, but he refuses. Over the past couple of years, the irises of his eyes have darkened and now they are almost black. I cant find any reason for this...he has not been on any long term drug therapy. I also cannot find a way to get help for my brother as he is an adult (in his 30s) and he refuses care. We live in Florida and even when he was Baker Acted, the doctors and nurses would not even listen to our accounts of what had been going on with him because he is an adult, and he was released after 72 hours because he told the doctors he was fine, even though he wasnt.

I started having pain on my lower right side of my back a few weeks ago. I have been tested for stones, UTIs, vaginal infections, STDs, and appendicitis, and all were normal. Because I was also having bladder urgency problems and retention and right abdominal pain. A few nights ago I started getting really sharp, intense pain at the top of my left toe, it only lasts a few seconds and then stops. I then started having back pain on both side of my lower and upper back so severe I find it hard to breath, and it wakes me up at night, but goes away after a short time and then comes back.

Had numerous Ekgs done, blood work, chest x-rays and a treadmill stress test. All came back (-) except an rbbb during my stress test. Dr. said not to worry that i did excellent on my stress test.

Hello. Im a college student who recently stated shooting up. I dont remember if this is a bruise or if its a spot where I shot up the other day. I was hospitalized 2 days ago for a few hours due to a severe allergic reaction I had to something unknown. I was going to sit down and play on the Internet when I noticed on my leg a black bruise looking thing. About the size of a golf ball. Its pink and black much like a bruise but has darker purple spots in the center of it. It doesnt hurt, but looks odd. On my legs there are some little like sores on my feet like a picked zit, there is no pus and they seem to be going away. Around my crotch area and upper leg theres scratches, anfew kind of look like smeered blood, from where I itched so hard from the reaction the other day. My sinus mucus is a dark yellow, been gettIng a cold it seems. Im curious, if i was in the hospital 2 days ago from an allergic reaction and they took my blood wouldnt they have seen if i was septic or not?? Or had blood poisoning?

Hi, My dad is 60 years old and his \"Nerves are Bad\", or at least thats what he calls it. When he was a teenager he was put into a mental hospital because of his panic attacks. They treated him poorly and gave him a very powerful medication that had unwelcome side effects and did not help. Because of this he refuses to see a doctor. He has been on social security/disability ever since and has not been able to hold a job my entire life. My father avoids most social situations and any situation where he may have to speak to someone and answer questions, in fact, I must be careful speaking with him, because even discussing the possibility of a job interview or a doctors visit can trigger a panic attack. He even gets incredibly irritable, nervous, anxious and angry if a stranger like a tax consultant or insurance broker or someone will be coming to the house later. I have noticed that when forced to be social, a few beers is all it takes for him to act pretty much normal. He is still a bit shy, but no panic attacks, and he will even tell jokes and perhaps even make friends. This tells me that the condition must be treatable (although obviously not with alcohol). Other symptoms include shaking his feet a lot and vigorously rubbing his hands together. He also would spend a lot of This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

I am a 50 year old male with a history of cervical spine injury. I have had a disc-ectomy with fusion in 2012 and in Feb of 2013 reinjured my neck in an auto accident. I, in the past greatly benefited from Oxycodone 10mg, It totally worked for me. Other medications such as Nambumetone, Naproxen, Cyclobenziprine, Amitriptyline, Prednisone, as well as several others were not effective. I am an electrician and I do a lot of tasks that are posture compromising. I am often required to crane my neck for extended periods, ( a recent pain management Dr did not know what craning of the neck meant) I have to access crawl spaces and attics. I have to manually bend conduit, and work overhead. I have to work above suspended ceilings off of a ladder, outstretching and reaching to pass wires along, By days end I am in agony. I am unable to get my current primary care physician to prescribe the one medication that works for me. Oxycodone.. I am aware of the dependency risks.

Hello, I am a 52yr old female. Average height and weight. I have had a total hysterectomy in 2006. I by chance had a d dimer ran about a year ago now and it was at 900. Thinking this was maybe this was my normal. They checked it again in a couple of weeks and it was 1,200 then 1,800, then 2,200 and as of yesterday it is 2,656. I have been to see Oncologist who ran multiple tests including CT of chest and US of legs. US was negative. CT shows two lung nodules and I will have another CT next month. I also have a positive ANA with an RNP antibody of greater than 8. I was sent to a Rheumatologist for this and that apt was a joke. He told me I didn t have Lupus and that was it. I am very concerned that I have a blood clot forming somewhere in my body that will break off and either give me a stroke, heart attack or aneurism. Any thoughts on why my d dimer is increasing. Any advise or response would be greatly appreciated. I do work in a lab and have been informed that it may be a blood clot. I have back pain and seem to catch myself breathing at a rapid rate without exertion. Please advise. Thank you.<|endoftext|>

( the only way i can describe it is intermittent pulsating shooting pains that come and go with no triggers) constant fatigue, feeling the need to empty my bowels constantly and when i do its very ressurinsed pain, black foul smelling stools. for 1 week now i have hav a hot water bottle constantly on my stomach, been taking merbeverine IBS tablets and drinking peppermint or cammomile tea. this is something i have never experienced before and even changed to a low FODMAP diet to try and tackle what i think is This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Ok I dont know if it is possible that I could be pregnant or not but I dont want to have a pregnancy test taken yet because part of me thinks its still too early to tell, while another part of me thinks I am pregnant. The reason part of me thinks that I might be pregnant, is because my last menstrual cycle was unusual. It was five days early, lighter, and shorter than what I am used to. Usually my period lasts three to four days and is 28-30 days between cycles. This last period was 1 1/2 days long to 2 days long. The reason that I think that I may not be pregnant is because I have had some stress in life that I have been dealing with. I live with my boyfriend, and we just moved along with starting a new job and quitting because of circumstances. I havent taken a pregnancy test of any kind other than ones on the computer that I have come across and they say that I may be or it is a possibility. I havent told anyone about this except some of my closest friends. My boyfriend doesnt even know yet because I dont want him getting his feelings hurt incase the test doesnt come out in our favor. So this is why I am asking you. Please feel free to comment and ask me questions. I have my reasons to believe that I can This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

So earlier today while I was minding my own buisness on the computer, this suddern day dream/flash back kinda thing happened. I was sat there and then all I could hear was the scream of a woman who sounded like she was being dragged away, and someone in my face who kept saying It s all going to be okay, I will all be fine, just stay there. This was all I could think about, I was wrapped in this thought that felt like a past experience, when I know nothing like this has ever happened to me before. This boilin hot feeling started happening on the inside of my chest, not painful, just extremely hot, and it kept happening. If I tried to hunk of something else, all I could hear was this screaming that brought me back. I was completely glazed over, i wasn t doing anything at all. And then I just cracked, I curled into a ball on my chair and just started crying, and couldn t stop, it was like I was hiding, I felt just petrified, curled up in a ball. After a few minutes, I got control again, and just put some music on and tried to forget about it, but it has been a shock to my system. I ve had minor panic attacks in the past, but non of them were this This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.

Had neck and back surgery in 2009. Ive been able to manage my pain with methadone 10mg.I take three every morning and two 350mg soma. And about eight hours later three more methadone and one more soma. But for the last four months my pain is much more intense and the meds just dont work or last long enough. My pain now goes down both legs pass the knee and to my feet more times than not. It is even to the point walking is so painful even sitting. I started taking steroid shots in back. It has helped but Im still in great pain. Im now to the point Im scared to do or go much of anything. Got a MRI my Dr says there nothing to worry about.This is what it said.  There is slight straightening of the normal lumber curvature. There has been posterior fusion of L3,L4;and L5 with metallic rods and bone screws in place. Anterior fusion is noted at L4/L5 with obliteration of the disc space noted. The conus extends to the L1level. Disc degeneration is noted at the L2/L3 level with desiccation of the disc demonstrated.

My 2 year old was playing and climbing at home last night and slipped backwards, causing her to tip her head backwards and bending her neck far enough that we heard a series of 4 pops (sounding like knuckles cracking). She immediately began crying and did so for about 3 minutes while we comforted her and then complained of neck pain for about 20 minutes afterwards, all while resuming playing with her toys, eating snack, and running around the house. I should note that she did NOT hit her head, as we were able to catch her in time, but her neck bent back pretty far. She went to sleep fine about an hour later, playing peekaboo and in a good mood. About 5 hours later, she woke up in the night (as she has been doing lately) and when she was walking around, we noticed she seemed stiff legged. When we asked her if anything hurt, she started touching her right leg and saying ow but also did the same thing with her left arm. She did not react to us touching either, nor did she react to us touching her neck at this point. Is this a sign of a neck injury that she could have suffered or is this to be expected after perhaps straining something?

I am a 22 year-old female and I had a root canal done a week ago. Prior to the root canal I complained of sensitivity and a feeling like a pocket was forming in the gum line on my upper left between my back tooth and my molar. My dentist did a root canal and prescribed clindamyacin for what I assume was an infection (he did not tell me what was really wrong). I went home waiting to return the following week to finish the root canal, but in that time, extreme sensitivity has emerged on the gum line and in between the molar and last tooth in 3 out of 4 of my molars (all aside from the bottom right). I have been brushing gently with a soft brush, using non-alcohol mouth washes, and flossing and the pain and bleeding just seems to be getting worse. I will be going to the dentist today, but I wanted a second opinion as to what could be going on. I had early signs of gingivitis in previous years, but have taken care of my teeth including brushing, flossing occasionally (not every day as I should) and using anti-gingivitis mouth washes. What could have caused the spread of such pain and bleeding in my gums over my molars in such a short time? Could it be related to my root This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

I am a 45 year old female, 5\" weighing in at 118 pounds. I have had bile duct spasms(which occur on and off) as well as stones in my bile duct(every 15 years or so)over the past 15 years. I also have panic disorder which is being well controlled. I am under a great deal of stress due to relationship issues and the caretaking of both my ill parents. Over the past year I have been experiencing episodes of feeling like I have eaten way toooooo much(even though i have eaten very little), shortness of breath, heart palpitations, pain in upper middle quadrant(middle under breast bone)through the back, the feeling of needing to burp and/or have a bowel movement. I have been checked for heart trouble(it is not this). My liver enzyemes are normal and the ultrasound taken to show possible liver issues are okay. I do not have a gallbladder and I have had a few ERCPs and one 2 that cut the bile duct to make it larger. The ERCPs showed nothing wrong. I am wondering if the stress that I have been experiencing may have changed avenues. In otehr words..instead of having panic attacks-I now have these bile duct spasms and what I believe might be a hiatal hernia This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Hi there, I was recently in contact with an individual who told me afterwards that he had HSV2. We kissed, rubbed penises together for no more than 20 seconds, and performed mutual oral sex only on each other. He told me his symptoms always present anally and he hasnt had an active outbreak in over a year. Unfortunately, at the time, I also had Oral Gonnorhea without knowing. I suffer from severe OCD about STDs so became compelled with the idea i had HSV2 especially given i broke out in a few spots around my lip line a week later. I had a sore throat, fever, chesty cough, congestion, aches, fatigue, headache, and even now over 3 weeks on im still not 100% back to best, still suffering from some symptoms. I was swabbed both anally as i was worried about inflammation in my anus (Hospital put it down to diahrrea which i d been having for over 3 weeks) and also orally - though on a mouth crack rather than one of the weird spots.

He has had his gall bladder and appendix taken out as well as having a bowel blockage bypassed and a j tube inserted. He is now experiencing pain every time he eats as well as more frequent bouts of constipation again accompanied by a lot of nausea after eating. I have him on resource 2.0 270 ML at 60ML/hr as well as a low fat, low fiber, low salt diet as tolerated by mouth. He takes Reglan to aid in digestion, as well as Nexium for Barrett s Esophagus and this is supplemented with Zantac once a day (nexium at night, zantac in the morning). He also takes Tramadol for pain, but if the pain gets to be too much he will exchange a dose or two for a dose or two of Oxycodone. What else can we do to ease his pain and constipation?

When I was 3 years old I was stung by a bee in the back of my right thigh. What kind of bee I do not know. That afternoon I was taken to hospital with a temp of 106 and subsequently diagnosed after some time with osteomyleitis. They were stumped for awhile. This was in the mid 1950 s. They always said the bee sting had nothing to do with the osteomyleitis. I almost died several times and was in hostilal for over a month and a half,developing pneumonia after I had been stable. Since,I have had terrible trouble with the leg the sting occurred,we think from damage to the illiac vein when dealing with the bone. I had developed vercosities,had a vein stripping at 19years old,a clot in the illiac in 1984 and again in 1996 that caused the vein to collapse. Since,I have become seriously disabled from the neuropathy,poor circulation and many other domino effects of the illiac vein having collapsed and no longer doing its job in my circulatory system.

Hi My Mum, aged 76, has cancer of the oesophagus. She was diagnosed in August and has since received chemotherapy, radiotherapy and had a stent fitted in November because she couldn t swallow food anymore. The Consultant told us in february that the cancer had not spread and that it had not grown but Mum was still very weak - nowhere near as good as the Consultant expected. She has spent 5 weeks in hospital and now 2 weekes in a hospice as an interim towards going home again - during most of this time she has had a chest infection and activity and talking have caused her to cough - very exhausting. She has improved but now she is coughing up and being sick with clear phlegm - often in bubbles. This happens when she eats and sometimes even when she isn t eating. She is now drinking special drinks for energy / protein etc. We have seen Mum do this being sick with phlegm before - just before she had the stent fitted. I wondered if the stent had become blocked or moved but the doctor says that if Mum is able to drink then the stent must still be ok. Do you know what could be causing this for Mum? The hospice are talking about sending her home soon and I don t see how she s going to manage if this continues. Thank you very much. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Hello, My problem is that I feel distracted, and I cannot focus on one thing, especially studying even though I used to study 5 hours a day. Sometimes, even though there is nothing in my mind, I feel there is like a wall that keeps me from focusing studying. I was diagnosed with ADD last year. I also was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I started by taking Adderall, Klonopin, and a medication for anxiety that causes sleepiness. I felt much better, and I could concntrate easily at that time. However, I started sleeping 14 hours a day, so my psychiatrist stopped both Adderall and decreased the dosage ofthe other medication that I don t know its name. She then gave me Concerta and abilify in addition to Klonopin. I felt as good as I was, and could easily concentrate. However, the same problem with sleeping came again. At that time, she stopped the medication that I don t remember its name and Concerta. She gave me wellbutrin and strattera. She gave me a low dose of strattera, and was planning to increase it later. After a month, I moved to a new city, and I told my psychiatrist that since I started using strattera, I didn t feel any improvement, so she stopped This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Hi Dr. Grief, I m Kevin a 23 year old male that was diagnosed with ADHD 6 years ago and have/continue to have success with 20 mg adderal IR 2 times a day. I ve had depression for as long as I can remember and have been treated with practically all SSRI/SNRI medications. I recently fell into the worse depression and anxiety of my life a few months ago. Voluntarily entered a crisis stabilization center for 30 days. While there, I was diagnosed with GAD, SAD, Major Depressive Disordder, and PTSD. Upon diagnosis I was prescribed Zoloft 75 mg, Trazodone 50 mg, and vistiral 25 mg PRN. I started these 3 new medications June 2nd and go for my first follow up appointment since leaving the treatment center on Monday. The vistiral is doing absolutely nothing for my anxiety, I ve been prescribed Klonopin in the past from my GP and would like to go back on that, but don t want to seem like Drug Seeker. Is there a way I should go about asking for it? I ve never had any abuse with medications in the past, but sadly there is a stigma out there for Benzos. My symptoms are by far worse then when I started these 3 new medications. I am letharg This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

I have a dull ache on my waistline on the rt. side about 7 ins. rt. of my navel. I have had irritable bowel for 5 years with sev. yrs. of burping and gas and lose bowel from 4 movements a day to diahrrea On occasion I would have this ache also. I had all the testing down to CAT and the Gastro doc said it is very common not to be able to find the cause and has had me on Immodium all this time and it is the only thing to hold back the many movements. Not that i like that but he said he has had people on it for years and it will not harm me. I tweaked it to 2 times a day because AM was not enough. I did find that Red wine in the evening can cause this dull ache but even without the wine I have the ache. We have had a great stressor hit our family which has me so beside myself and I can only be thankful for our health because the stressor is a huge 2nd. The stressor has no way out other at this time. Our family consists of daughter and myself. I am worried about it being something physically serious. What might I check out with my doctor or what is in that area? Can stress cause all of this?

Since the last week in Feb, I have had abdominal pain. Started with the upper left quadroon, and causes back pain. My belly is swollen or distended, it becomes worse when I eat. Bowels vary from, normal to diarrhea, very foul smelling. I have been to the ER twice, been to Primary multiple times (who has now dropped me as patient, because I keep asking for pain meds) Pain is pretty much constant and intolerable. Right now i am taking one tramadol with two tylenol every four hours. This helps a little but not much. My white blood count is high (although I dont have #s, I was told this by PCP. CAT SCAN with contrast dye, did not show any problems with organs. However i do not know it the intestines or colon was looked at. I think the ER is also thinking I may be looking for drugs now too, but I could be just paranoid. I do have Alpha 1 Anti Trypsin and Factor V Leiden. Blood pressure has  been high for me since this has started. Normally blood pressure is on good low side, no cholestrol problems, never had any stomach issues in the past. They did find a small Kidney stone on right side, but pain is primarily on above left and This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Hello Dr. Grief, This morning I tried to lift something very heavy. When doing so I did the wrong thing and used my back to try and lift it. When I did this I could feel a tearing down the middle of my back on both sides of my spine. It felt like it was in the middle of my back but it could have been higher or lower. After doing so I started to feel pain in the front part of my legs and in the front of my lower abdomen. I decided to take some Ibuprofen and lay on the floor on my back, feet and legs elevated and an ice pack under my back 20 minutes on and off. I did this for a few hours. The front leg and abdomen pain has subsided for the most part. But now I have pain in both sides of my upper back just below my shoulder blades and moves around to the front of my lower rib cage. And my hands are slightly numb. If I try to bend over to pick something up I have great pain in my lower back. But I can raise myself up and down by using my legs and Knees and keeping by back straight. I can move about normally for the most part but with great restrictions in my movements as not to feel any pain. How bad do you think I hurt myself or is this normal when This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.

OK so here is the deal, my whole life as far as i can remember i have been an emotionless, shallow, uncaring person. Nothing to do with my child hood, it was great. This has just been the way I am for some reason. I mean seriously you could blow someones head off in front of me an my response would be that sucks and walk away, my father always told me i would make the perfect soldier in the military.. I m not crazy, depressed or any of that dumb stuff. Just empty/emotionless inside. But the one day my friend hands me this pill, well it was a pain killer that changed me like no other. I loved my job, my friends, was very open, caring, had emotions, I was a completely different person, i felt......human. Well it lasted a month an was like forget this i m not gonna be a junkie. So back to the blah me, month later another friend hands me a Valium. Well, it didn t make me as happy/outgoing as the painkillers but little things wouldn t bother me, controlled my temper, i was very relaxed and easy going.

Hi, my 10yr old (11 this year) daughter has been complaining of abdominal cramping, lower back pain, headaches, nausea, tiredness and muscle weakness for the past 2 to 3 weeks. It is standard for the females in our family to develop early ( I got my first period just after turning 11 and by that time I had full size breasts) my daughter has been developing breasts for around 6 - 8 months now and is starting to notice a slight size difference between them already. We have spoken to local woman s health doctors who suspect she is about to start menstruating which makes perfect sense given the family history but since I didn t have cramping or any other warning signs when I got mine ( or at least none that I can recall ), We would like to know how long it normally takes from when the symptoms start to when the periods start. Does it take weeks? Months? and is there anything I can do for her or get for her to make this transition as comfortable for her as possible? She keeps pads and spare underwear with her at all times (discretely of course) and I am going to get her a hot water bottle this week along with anything else you think would be helpful. I have made sure she knows everything she could possibly want or need to know so she has no shortage of information, love This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Plus I had a big lump in the middle of my back that lasted for a couple of months before going away. Since then I ve had my hips pelvis and knees start to hurt. I can t get up off of floor easily, can t sleep, can t bend over too much or sit for long periods of time. Plus a couple if times my shoulder blades felt like they were on fire and that pain traveled down my arms to my hands and caused shooting pain in both of my thumbs and pointer fingers. My accident was in November and I m not only still in pain but its worse. I ve tried physical therapy but its not helped. Other than that they have me on a muscle relaxant which makes me sick and they won t give me any kind of scans. I just want to know if this is serious. Please if you can give me a little insight. Thank you for your time.<|endoftext|>

Sir, Recently when performing my routine health checkup, i found that my blood platelet count have been reduced to 90,000 (report date 31.3.2010). My WBC count is also close to the lower normal limit of 4.7 X 10^3. Last test was performed on 17.11.2008 and my platelet count at that time on Peripheral Blood Flim was \"low normal\" and the WBC count was 5.2X10^3. All the other test like blood glucose, thyroid, lipid profile etc are totally normal. I am aged 39 yrs and my weight is 75 kgs with BP of 120/80 mm Hg. This decease in platelet count and the gradual decrease in WBC count have put me in a very tense situation. The Doctor advised me to follow up for a complete blood count after 1 month and if there is further fall in platelet, then a bone marrow test is needed to be done. I am also suffering from lots of stress and anxiety since many years owing to my profession and home and is a regular taker of alprazolam/drugs. I would therefore request you to let me know how can i get rid of this problems since this situation have further aggravated my mental condition and made my life worse. With regards Somit Das<|endoftext|>

I ve been to nearly 10 different doctors, and I m at my wit s end! Nobody seems to know what the problem is!! About 3 weeks ago I began to have a dull but constant pain in my left side, right underneath the rib cage. It started on the same day as my period, so I thought it was related. Everything was normal with my period, but the pain didn t go away when the period ended. By that time, the pain was starting to radiate to my lower left pelvis, right near where my ovary is. I also started to feel the frequent need to urinate. I visited the GP and they did an ultrasound and found a small (4mm) stone in my left kidney. They told me it was a kidney stone that possibly caused a UTI. They gave me antobiotics, but the symptoms just got worse. A few days later, the pain in my lower left abdomen spread to my flank. It was now a stabbing/twisting pain. I went back to the doctor again, and they did a CT scan. Everything came back normal, and my kidneys tested normal as well. They found a small cyst on my ovary, but it proved to be a functioning cyst and cleared up after a couple of days. All of my blood tests and urine tests are normal and show no This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.

Hello doctor, afew days about 10 days back ihad pain in my abdomen. Suspecting gastric problem i visited a gastroeterologist. After endoscopy and ultrasound scan of the abdomen were found normal, he suggested a LFTs. My total bilirubin came 2.88 mg/dl. My other para meters were also found to be high. I also had light fever with chill and body aches the night before. My eyes were light yellow and urine was very yellow with orange tint. Stools were very pale. However the doctor did not prescribe any medicine but asked me to avoid fatty foods and achohol. However I followed a moderate jaundice diet for a week. Got LFTs done again. Total bilrubin is 1.09 and all other parameters just on the upper limit of normal ranges. My urine and stools are normal colour except that iam passing stools once in 3 days. Visited doctor again. He said there is no problem and ican get on normally. No diet restriction or even on alchohol aslong asit is moderate. Now did i suffer from jaundice? If so what type? Was it serious? Can i follow the advice of Dr and eat and drink normally from right now? Will appreciate your advice. I live in India and am This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Hi and good morning, My Friend is in severe condition at the moment, and what frustrates me is that the doctors who are attending her in ICU cannot give us any final diagnosis about her illness, the 3 doctors have different opinions each time we visit the patient, she is now in the ICU for 12 days...her condition as follows; - Female - 23 yrs. old - No History of Alcoholism and No Drug Abuse usage - She was admitted to the Emergency Area for Avute Pacreatitis - then the doctors have admitted her to ICU because of a very high lipid presence in her blood - she had received a Plasma Exchange (about 6 times or more) - she is undergoing a slow Dialysis everyday as (the doctor claims) she had rhenal failure and the dialysis will help her recover her kidneys - she is under a ventilator or an oxygen and this is helping her breath - what we cannot understand is why now she is under going blood transfussion (the doctor said that her hemoglobin is very low and the transfussion is needed) - her other vital organs are normal ( liver and hearth is stable) What confusses us is that the doctors in Macao still cannot determine the cause of her illness and we are afraid that she is being treated as a guinea pig...

Dear Sir/Madame, I have a question for you. Namely, a week after I had unprotected sex, I started having pregnancy symptoms. First it started with headache, lower backpain, abdominal cramps (slightly similar to menstrual cramps), and very sore breasts (something I have never had before). After few days, I started having extreme fatique, lightheaded, dizziness, urinating more frequently, white creamy discharge, occassional pinching on my lower abdominal area, and acne all over my cheeks. I got my menstrual period exactly after 4 weeks, but it was much lighter than usual and I had normal bleeding for one night, where as the rest was coming and going through out the day and much lighter. After exactly 4 weeks I again got my period with the same pattern (I never get my period exactly 28 days apart two times in a row). I did quantative analysis of Beta ChatDoctor in what would have been 6th week gestatonial age (if I were pregnant ), and my B ChatDoctor was less than 1. In the meanwhile, my lower abdomen keeps getting bigger (I am very slender, and never have I had such bloated lower abdomen--my friends keep asking me if I am pregnant, since my lower abdomen is shaped in such a way that it looks as if I am This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

The roof of my mouth is sore and swollen in some areas specially on the left side behind upper front teeth. I have a sinus allergy due to dust / weather because of which my nose remains perpetually closed and 80-90% of the time I am breathing through my mouth (consciously and unconsciously) including at night when sleeping This has caused multiple problems in the past, as esp. when weather is changing and my nose is worse, breathing from my mouth causes dry and parched lips, sore throat, and the sore/swollen mouth roof. However, the mouth roof problem is fairly recent, and this is only the second time it is happening now (earlier it was mostly sore throat followed by a flu/fever) The first time it happened, it went away in a couple of days as I applied oral gel. This time around its been four days and its going from bad to worse. Am not skipping meals, so no malnutrition, eating healthy, and no dehydration as I drink lots of water (except after a night s sleep when my mouth is parched due to breathing from mouth and dryness in air). I have taken Folic Acid as advised by some family/friends and also taking more water/milk and have applied oral gel before going to bed each night. Since the start of this mouth roof problem This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.

I am 25 years old and over the past few months have been extremely tired all the time. I had a baby in June of 2010, so she is almost 8 months. She sleeps through the night, so its not that I am being kept awake at all hours.  I find myself to be so tired, even after 7 to 8 hours of sleep I cant drag myself out of bed. I am litterally so tired when I am trying to get up, my eyes seem like they close on their own and I fall back asleep without even knowing it - until I wake up again.....I have trouble eating during the day as I feel too tired to even bother. My body feels exhausted and I feel like I have to lug myself around the house, and feel like I get nothing done that I need to.  Although this has been happening for a few months, I find it to be much worse when I am about to get my period and then for the whole timme I have it - like extreme tiredness.  I just want to enjoy my last few months at home with my baby and make the most of it but I feel too tired to even play with her most times. My doctor suggested depression when I talked to him a few months ago but didnt give me anything for it....I dont agree that it could be depression as This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Help! I have urticaria on my buttocks and thighs - humidity and tight pants might be a factor. I first noticed the red irregular bumps on my buttocks about 4 years ago in the summer after returning from the beach/ pool. I continued to get it every summer since after sunbathing; it lasts for 2 to 3 weeks and then it goes away. This year however, I got it in February (I was pregnant at the time) and its been coming back on and off in small bumps since then. I finally saw a dermatologist who did a biopsy; the diagnosis- papular urticaria. In hope for an answer, I saw an allergist as well - turns out im allergic to dust mites and cockroach (not known to cause hives). Yesterday I went to a hot yoga class; the room was warmer than usual and i sweated profusely. I got home and my right thigh was covered in red bumps of different sizes, some even expended into a massive red area overnight - they are somewhat itchy and my skin feels as sensitive as when I get sunburn. My left thigh is not as affected - just a few red bumps. I take Allegra on a regular basis and I used anti - itch lotion  for the first time today (Itch Fix, This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

i had came out of school and i was single. i have started working for a company and had devoted myself to them. Through out the first few months working for this company. I had began to noticed that i have a skin disorder called Vitiligo. This has impacted me as i had went into a depression for awhile. I was my own coach and although my father has it i knew it was genetic. Through the years i had seek help for vitiligo, but came to terms that there is nothing else that can be done but wear makeup. However the field i m in is stressful, and there are many demands on workers like myself. Nonetheless i had met someone outside of my work who has a child and since then we now have 2 other boys of which the older and youngest ones have disabilities. The other thing is my preevious employer, i m sure had feeliings for me and was jealous of my spouse. I felt harrassed many times as my employer was personally picking on me. This employer even made up a lie about my spouse which tried to get me into trouble about breaking confientiality. I had felt stressed to go to work.

I believe I have tonsillitis having symptoms of sore throat, sore neck glands, swollen tonsils with the puss, difficulty and painful swallowing and body ache. I am aware I will need antibiotics for this but unfortunately I am allergic to almost all antibiotics except sulphur ones. I have veeb using natural antibiotics such as lemon, salt and honey. I have been doing some reading about how strep bacteria can spread and cause rheumatic disease. About a week and half prior to having this sore throat, I have felt my heart palpitating and beats at abnormal rate everyday. I queried if it was my asthma but it s definitely not my lungs but my chest/heart that felt odd. Five days on and the sore throat feels worse, and also I started feeling something stuck down the trachea everytime I swallow. I woke up the next day and it feels it has gone down again to mid chest as I find it tight and painful to swallow and bring my food down. Because it is the Christmas/New Year Holiday I am hesitatant to go to the hospital Emergency Depatment kowing I will be there all day. I was thinking of waiting until the endof the week when my regular general practitioner s clinic will be open. But with the chest tightness symptom, I am getting a bit worried.

Hello.... My boyfriend has had an amputation of the big toe on the left foot. The first one was about 2 months ago.... He was out sof work almost four straight weeks. The doctor finally cut him lose and he went back to work when he went back to work, he worked like 3 or 4 days and he got all kinds of pain, swelling and discharge the pain was unbearable. So, we went back to hospital and they admitted and went back in for a 2nd surgery and more infected tissue was amputated as well. He has worked one week and now he has lots of pain but no high blood pressure, some swelling but no heat in/around where the stitches were. By the way he is not diabetic either. He is 56 years old and had ostiomalytis a few years back and the third toe on the right foot. He never had all this much trouble with the first amputation. My real? IS right now is he is off from work and it is swollen like I said no fever or hotness no discharge......

I am a male age 23. I have been diagnosed with hypertension. The reading I was diagnosed with was around 160/80 when I was 21 years old. I was run through a series of tests which found nothing abnormal with me aside from elevated triglycerides which I was able to control after I took up exercise and reduced my weight by 16 lbs. I was put on Inderal 40mg b.i.d. This medication brought my bp down to 130/80 with a pulse of 72. However I suffered many side effects. Being a student I found it difficult to concentrate or sleep well, I also had nightmares,insomnia and memory loss. So I was switched to Atenolol 50mg which also caused me insomnia and memory loss but was not as bad as Inderal. Over a period of a few months of weight loss and exercise I came to 25mg of Atenolol at which time my Bp was 132/76. But due to the side effects I was switched to Diltiazem CD 120mg. This medication caused no side effects at first but over a period of a few weeks I developed negative moods, a severe headache similar to a migraine 24 by 7, rashes on my forehead, weakness and lethargy, flushing and feeling warm and a warm sensation in the chest area This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

I was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis in August and was sent for a HIDA Scan. Result was an ejection fraction of 9% at 30 minutes post sincalide, consistent with dysfunctional gallbladder and chronic cholecystitis. I was referred to a surgeon for removal of gallbladder. The surgeon ordered an ultrasound and found distended gallbladder with no stones. He advised against removal of gallbladder and ordered an endoscopic ultrasound which was performed two days ago. The results were normal, but now they want to follow-up with an MRI in 3 months. I am absolutely a non-drinker , but my diet is not great. Also, I have iron deficiency anemia and my blood glucose level is somewhat elevated. I am on the brink of type 2 diabetes.  My primary care doc feels very strongly that the gallbladder should be removed, and I am very confused. The surgeon doesnt respect the HIDA Scan. He claims the test is unreliable because it can change on a daily basis. Is this true? Two of my three daughters have had their gallbladders removed. The oldest daughter had acute pancreatitis and had several ultrasounds, none of which showed stones, but did suggest sludge. She became very ill during her pregnancy and had to have gallbladder removed at 18 weeks pregnant This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Hello Dr. Goyal, thank you very much for offering your service.  I was born with asthma, it would be mostly seasonal when I was younger.  I didnt have to treat it all the time, but when I had the occasional asthma attack it would be pretty serious, almost to the point of hospitalization.  As I grew older, the asthma became less and less apparent.  Up until about 2 months ago, I had not had any asthma symptoms for several years. Then, I did.  It went away for a week, so I thought it was ok.  Then, it came back, and it was very scary trying to breathe at night. I went to a doctor and they said I had pneumonia.  The antibiotics they gave me didnt seem very effective, and a few days later they also started me on a regiment of steroids.  The steroids helped, as did a nebulizer.  I was resting and feeling very ill for about a week and a half of that period, then I started to feel better.  Well, that only lasted a few days, and now for the past few days it has been getting worse again, necessitating several nebulizer treatments yesterday, and (after much effort and wheezing) coughing up mucus with a strange bittersweet taste (perhaps the albut This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

I am 16 and half weeks pregnant And was told yesterday at the Dr that my baby might have Trisomy 18 but they dont know for sure yet. because i havent had a amnio.But the dr I seen was not my actual dr. It was at a different hospital. But they said we where gonna lose our baby just from looking at the ultrasound. But ever since I have been pregnant i have had brown vaginal discharge which my dr says is normal and fine. But ever since yesterday after i went to the dr I have had the same light brown discharge but its now a light pink with clumps or chunks in it. When they said i was gonna lose the baby they said they didnt know when or how.But yesterday our baby was moving around like crazy on the screen and the heart rate was 153 and its been around that since ive been pregnant. But I was just worried after having the light pink discharge with clump or chunks. what that might be???? I havent had any cramps or pains or anything tho. But yesterday when they did the ultrasound they did a vaginal ultrasound. And I didnt know if maybe the light pink chunks where maybe the lining of my uterus or maybe dead skin cells or something and when they did the vagnial ultrasound it maybe knocked some of the dead skin cells or lining lose or something.

Hello, my 83 year old aunt who is a dibetic, has a metallic taste in her mouth. is has disrupted her life to the point she has stopped eating and now drinks only orange juice. my 79 year old mother my aunts youngest sister is very worried about her and asked for some sort of reason for this. My aunt heas not gone to the hospital yet but will go if it become much more serious. thank you...........I should have known there was some kind of hook hidden in your website. i understand that a doctor cant work for free but couldnt you be upfront enough tonote on the first line of you ad that there is a fee, albeit a small one but to receive your answer you will have to pay. some of us less paid individuals dont have the exrta $15 or $30 dollars to pay out when our family members are ill. our medical system here in canada is set up so that we can be treated for anything at a minimal cost or in other cases for free. i am sorry that i wasted both your time as well as mine to have a question answered that may be completely different from the actual problem. i feel i have been misled by your site.
