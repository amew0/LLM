Typhoid is a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella Typhi, and it's essential to ensure that the infection is fully cleared before attempting to conceive.\n\nTypically, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients with typhoid fever be treated for at least 7-10 days with antibiotics to ensure clearance of the bacteria. Since your husband was treated for only 3 days, it's possible that the infection was not fully cleared.\n\nI would recommend waiting for at least 7-10 days after the completion of antibiotics to ensure that the infection is fully cleared.

The fact that your daughter has been on 10 different antibiotics and has not responded to treatment is concerning.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to clarify that strep vaginitis is not a condition that typically affects children, let alone a 5-year-old. The vagina is not fully developed until puberty, and it's rare for young children to have vaginal infections.\n\nGiven the lack of response to antibiotics and the absence of any underlying cause identified during the examination under anesthesia, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Consult a pediatric infectious disease specialist: Given the complexity of your daughter's case, it may be helpful to seek a second opinion from a pediatric infectious disease specialist. They can help evaluate the situation and provide guidance on further testing and treatment options.\n2. Consider additional testing: In addition to the initial examination under anesthesia, it may be helpful to perform additional tests to rule out other potential causes of your daughter's symptoms. This could include tests for other types of infections, such as yeast infections or bacterial vaginosis, or even a referral",

Typically, women are advised to start birth control pills within seven days of their last menstrual period because it is unlikely that she would've already ovulated at that time.

However, even if you ovulated right when you started to take the pill, it is unlikely that the egg would still be viable to be fertilized after seven days.  Therefore, waiting seven days before having unprotected intercourse most likely was enough time to ensure that you would not become pregnant. Modern pregnancy tests will become positive within 10 days to two weeks after conception, so if you do not have a menstrual period at the end of your pill pack, you should perform a urine pregnancy test to be safe.

A bone spur, also known as an osteophyte, is a bony growth that can cause pain and stiffness in the wrist. While these natural remedies may provide some relief, they are not a substitute for proper medical treatment.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Calcium and vitamin D: While calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone health, taking 500 mg of calcium daily is unlikely to significantly reduce the size or alleviate the symptoms of a wrist bone spur. Additionally, vitamin D is not directly related to the treatment of bone spurs.\n2.

Ice application: Applying ice to the affected area may provide temporary pain relief, but it is not a long-term solution for treating the underlying condition.\n4.

As your paternal side grandmother and aunt suffered with breast cancer and ovarian cancer indicates they are your second/third degree relatives. For BRA 1 & BRA 2 either maternal or paternal side your are under high risk for inheriting the gene. Thus go for BRA 1 & BRA 2 testing. As u not attended menopause and u had no children thus which increases your general risk of developing cancer apart from gene defect. Thus, i advice to go for yearly screening apart from BRA gene screening.",
        "generated": "\n\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you with that.\n\nIt's great that you're taking proactive steps to assess your risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. While your PCM may have initially dismissed your concerns due to the cancer being on your father's side, it's essential to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Paternal transmission:** Although cancer on your father's side might seem less relevant, some BRCA mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to increase the risk of developing cancer. This is particularly important for BRCA1, which has been associated with paternal transmission.\n2. **Cancer risk:** Even if the cancer occurred on your father's side, the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer is still increased. According to the National Cancer Institute, women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer on either their mother's or father's side have an increased risk of developing these cancers.\n3. **Cyst on your left ovary:** While the ultrasound report may have indicated that the cyst is normal, it's essential to keep in mind that ovarian cysts can be benign or malignant. The presence of a cyst, especially in a woman with a strong family",

The decayed tooth might be a wisdom tooth, that is non-functional, If it is in a normal position then we can restore it and save it. If it is not in a normal position and if it is troubling the adjacent tooth, there is no meaning in keeping that tooth. It might get infected, or it can damage the adjacent tooth also. So it's better to get the tooth removed under local anesthesia. Consult an oral and maxillofacial surgeon and get it removed. I hope my answer will help you, take care.",
        "generated": "\n\nThank you for sharing your concerns with me. It sounds like you're experiencing some issues with your lower back teeth.\n\nFrom what you've described, it seems like you have caries (tooth decay) on your lower back teeth, which is a common condition. The slanted position of your teeth, also known as an overbite or crossbite, can put additional pressure on your teeth and gums, which may be contributing to the decay.\n\nThe fact that your doctor has recommended extraction as the only solution suggests that the decay is quite advanced and may have reached the pulp of the tooth, which is the soft tissue inside the tooth containing nerves and blood vessels. In this case, extraction may be necessary to prevent further complications, such as infection or abscesses.\n\nHowever, before proceeding with extraction, I would like to ask a few more questions to better understand your situation:\n\n1. Have you experienced any sensitivity or pain in your teeth or gums, aside from the mentioned slight discomfort?\n2. Have you noticed any signs of infection, such as swelling, redness, or pus around the affected teeth?\n3. Have you been experiencing any difficulty chewing or eating due to the slanted position of your teeth?\n4. Have you had any previous dental work or treatments for this",

As the shooting and shock appearance of the pain is more of a neuropathic and needs an attention. Since the history suggest about the one side limb pain and also the head pain, I will advise you to get a thorough neurological examination done and also an MRI later of either the brain or the cervical region. As post thorough neuromuscular examination and by understanding the MRI reports we can come to a conclusion. Also, we need to know if there is any motor functions compromise or not.

I'm here to help you figure out what's going on with these shooting pains in your left arm and head.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it can be quite distressing to experience frequent and intense pains, and I'm here to help you get to the bottom of it.\n\nBased on your description, I'm going to take a few possibilities into consideration:\n\n1. **Migraines**: It's possible that you're experiencing migraines with aura, which can cause intense, sharp pains in the arm and head. The frequency and duration you described could be consistent with this diagnosis.\n2. **Tension headaches**: Tension headaches can also cause sharp, stabbing pains, especially in the neck and head. The fact that the pain is mostly on one side (left) and is accompanied by arm pain could be indicative of a tension headache.\n3. **Neurological conditions**: Other possibilities could include conditions like trigeminal neuralgia, which is a chronic pain disorder that affects the trigeminal nerve, or occipital neuralgia, which affects the nerves in the back of the head.\n4. **Musculoskeletal issues**: It's also possible that the pain is related to a musculoskeletal issue,",

Long term dermatitis is usually due to allergic or other causes not due to infection. For me, it does not appear to be infective dermatitis, so there is no need of antibiotic. Monomer contains ceftriaxone and it is an injectable antibiotic. It is not available in oral form. Monocef-o contains cefuroxime protein, and it is available in tab form. Even if antibiotic is needed Monocef-o is not a very good choice. Most of the skin infections occur due to infection of staphylococcus. Amoxicillin or amoxicillin with clavulanate is a better choice. Dose of monocef-o is 10-15 mg/kg/day in two divided dosage. I would suggest you to consult a skin specialist for reevaluation of the condition and management accordingly.",
