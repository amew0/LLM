Untreated or incompletely treated typhoid can lead to complications during pregnancy, including miscarriage, preterm labor, and fetal growth restriction.\n\nIn this scenario, it's crucial to wait until your husband's infection is fully cleared before attempting to conceive. I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Consult with your husband's doctor to discuss the blood test report and confirm that the infection is still present.\n2. The doctor may recommend a longer course of antibiotics or a different treatment regimen to ensure the infection is fully cleared.\n3. Once the infection is cleared, it's recommended to wait for at least 2-3 weeks after completing the treatment before attempting to conceive. This allows for any remaining bacteria to be eliminated and reduces the risk of transmission to the fetus during pregnancy.\n\nIt's also important to",

Premature birth can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising due to the baby's fragile blood vessels and immature blood clotting mechanisms. Additionally, the forceps delivery may have caused micro-tears in the blood vessels, leading to bleeding and bruising.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider other possible causes of bruising in a premature baby, such as:\n\n1. Vitamin K deficiency: Premature babies are at a higher risk of vitamin K deficiency, which can lead to bleeding and bruising. Vitamin K plays a crucial role in blood clotting, and a deficiency can cause prolonged bleeding.\n2. Hemophilia: Although rare, some premature babies may be born with hemophilia, a genetic disorder that affects blood clotting. This could contribute to excessive bleeding and bruising.\n3.

However, even if you ovulated right when you started to take the pill, it is unlikely that the egg would still be viable to be fertilized after seven days.  Therefore, waiting seven days before having unprotected intercourse most likely was enough time to ensure that you would not become pregnant. Modern pregnancy tests will become positive within 10 days to two weeks after conception, so if you do not have a menstrual period at the end of your pill pack, you should perform a urine pregnancy test to be safe.

In your case, the bloody stools occurred on the 6th day of treatment, which is a common time for complications to arise.\n\nThe diagnosis of non-specific colitis based on the colonoscopy and biopsy report is reasonable. Non-specific colitis is a term used to describe inflammation of the colon that does not have a specific underlying cause or characteristic histopathological features.\n\nGiven that you had a history of typhoid fever, it's possible that the bloody diarrhea you experienced was related to the infection. Typhoid fever can cause inflammation and damage to the gut lining, leading to bleeding and diarrhea. The bloody stools may have been a manifestation of this inflammatory process.\n\nThe fact that you are now fine and your stool is normal suggests that the colitis was likely a transient and self-limiting condition. It's also possible that the colitis resolved on its own or was treated with antibiotics or other medications.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that non-specific colitis can also be a precursor to more serious conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and",

It's essential to consult with your healthcare provider or the doctor who prescribed the antibiotic to discuss the following options:\n\n1. Stop the antibiotic: If the test results were negative, it's likely that the antibiotic is not targeting the underlying cause of your symptoms. Stopping the antibiotic may help prevent unnecessary antibiotic resistance and potential side effects.\n2.

If it becomes painful, grows in size, or changes in appearance, it's best to seek medical attention.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, even if the lump is benign, it's still important to have it evaluated by a healthcare professional to rule out any potential complications or underlying conditions",

Calcium and vitamin D supplements may not address the underlying cause of the bone spur, which is often related to wear and tear, injury, or inflammation.\n2. Wrist bone spurs are typically caused by degenerative changes in the joint, which cannot be reversed by calcium and vitamin D supplements alone.\n3. Ice application may provide temporary relief from pain and inflammation, but it is not a treatment for the underlying bone spur.\n\nTurmeric and ginger, which contain anti-inflammatory compounds, may help alleviate symptoms such as pain and inflammation.

If your father had a BRCA mutation, you could still be at risk.\n3. **Ovarian cyst:** The presence of a cyst on your left ovary may not necessarily be normal. While it's common for women to develop ovarian cysts, the presence of a cyst can also be a sign of underlying hormonal imbalances or other health issues.\n4. **Age:** You're 53 years old, which is considered a",

        "generated": "\n\nI'd be happy to help you with your concerns, Laura. It's understandable that you're frustrated with the ongoing dizziness and uncertainty about the cause and treatment.\n\nBased on your description, it seems that you're experiencing a type of dizziness known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is a common condition characterized by brief, recurring episodes of vertigo (spinning sensation) triggered by specific head movements or changes in position.\n\nThe fact that your dizziness is exacerbated by bending down, looking up, or changing positions, and that it's triggered by certain stores or environments, supports the diagnosis of BPPV. The fact that your MRI and ENG (electronystagmography) tests came back normal doesn't necessarily rule out BPPV, as these tests may not always detect the underlying cause of the vertigo.\n\nThe doctor who performed the ENG test mentioned that they might have found something, but your father's concerns about your family doctor's willingness to perform a specific test might have limited the investigation. I would recommend discussing your concerns and test results with your family doctor or a specialist, such as an otolaryngologist (ENT) or a neurologist, to get a more comprehensive evaluation and potential",

The low-dose pill you're taking is designed to mimic a natural menstrual cycle, but it can take some time for your body to adjust.\n\nGiven that you've had a normal period until this month, and now you're experiencing cramping and nausea, it's possible that your body is just going through a bit of a transition. The cramping could be related to hormonal fluctuations, and the nausea might be a side effect of the pill itself.\n\nHowever, since you're several days late and haven't had a period, it's also possible that you might be experiencing a breakthrough bleeding or spotting due to hormonal changes. Breakthrough bleeding is common when starting a new hormonal birth control method, and it can be triggered by a variety of factors, including hormonal fluctuations, changes in estrogen levels, or even stress.\n\nThe fact that your home pregnancy test was negative suggests that pregnancy is unlikely, but it's always a good idea to take a test again in a few days to confirm.\n\nConsidering you took your pill a few hours late a few times,",

The pressure on your knees, combined with the changes in air pressure and humidity during the flight, can cause inflammation and discomfort.\n\nGiven your history of growing pains, it's possible that your knee pain is related to joint instability or misalignment, which can be exacerbated by the flight.

As a smoker, you're more likely to experience acid reflux due to the relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) muscle, allowing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus. The burning pain in your chest, especially when you drink brandy and coke, is a classic symptom of GERD.\n\nThe wheezing when you sleep and occasional coughing could be related to postnasal drip, which is a common symptom of GERD. When stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus, it can irritate the lining and cause inflammation, leading to increased mucus production. This mucus can then drip down the back of your throat, causing coughing and wheezing.\n\nThe two episodes of severe burning pain in your chest when drinking brandy and coke could be a sign of acid reflux-induced esophagitis, which is inflammation of the esophageal lining.

They are often used as markers to assess liver function.\n\nBased on your lab results:\n\n* SGPT (ALT): 56 IU/L (normal range: 10-40 IU/L)\n* SGOT (AST): 42 IU/L (normal range: 10-40 IU/L)\n\nYour results indicate that both enzymes are elevated, which suggests that there is some degree of liver damage or inflammation. The exact cause of this damage is not clear from the lab results alone, but I can offer some possible interpretations:\n\n1. **Mild liver inflammation**: The elevation of both enzymes could be due to mild inflammation or damage to the liver, which may be caused by a viral infection, such as hepatitis B (which is suggested by your positive HBsAg and HBe-Ag results). However, the levels of SGPT and SGOT are not extremely high, which may indicate that the liver damage is not severe.\n2. **Other causes**: Elevated liver enzymes can also be caused by other factors, such as medications, autoimmune disorders, or underlying liver disease.

The twitching you're describing, which originates in the groin area and shoots down to your feet, is consistent with this condition.\n\nBenign fasciculation syndrome is a common condition that can affect anyone, regardless of age or sex. The exact cause is often unknown, but it's thought to be related to muscle fatigue, electrolyte imbalances, or minor nerve irritation.\n\nThe symptoms you're experiencing, such as the twitching occurring every 30 seconds, are typical of BFS. The fact that it's affecting both feet and is not painful is also consistent with this condition.\n\nAs for the impact on your sleep, it's not uncommon for BFS to disrupt sleep patterns, especially if the twitching is frequent or intense. The good news is that BFS is generally a benign condition, and it's not a sign of any underlying serious medical condition.\n\nTo manage your symptoms, you can try the following:\n\n1. Stretching: Gentle stretching exercises can help reduce muscle tension and alleviate twitching. Focus on stretching your legs, hips, and lower back.\n2. Relaxation techniques: Stress",

Since it's connected to the kidney by an artery or vein, we can infer that it's likely fed by a single vessel.\n\nTypically, a tumor like an angiolypoma would be supplied by a single artery or vein that arises from the renal artery or vein, respectively. This is because the tumor is likely to develop from a single abnormal vessel or a cluster of vessels that arise from a single parent vessel.\n\nIn your case, since the embolization didn't shrink the tumor, it's possible that the tumor has developed multiple feeding vessels or that the embolization wasn't effective in blocking all the feeding vessels. However, without further imaging studies or surgical exploration, it's difficult to determine the exact number of vessels feeding the tumor.\n\nAs a 64-year-old patient, you may want to consider discussing further treatment options with your healthcare provider, such as repeat embolization, surgery, or close monitoring.

        "generated": "\n\nI'm happy to help you with your question!\n\nBased on your history, you've been taking Clomid for 2 cycles and received the trigger shot, which suggests you're trying to conceive. Given the size of the follicles on your right ovary (22cm and 24cm), it's likely that ovulation has already occurred or is about to occur.\n\nThe timing of intercourse is crucial when trying to conceive. Since you've received the trigger shot, it's likely that ovulation will occur 24-48 hours after the injection. This is because the trigger shot contains human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which mimics the natural surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) that typically occurs around ovulation.\n\nConsidering this, I would recommend having intercourse 24-48 hours after the trigger shot injection. This timing increases the chances of fertilization occurring around the time of ovulation.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that ovulation can occur earlier or later than expected, so it's crucial to monitor your body's natural signs of ovulation, such as changes in cervical mucus, basal body temperature, or ovulation predictor kits (OPKs).\n\nAdditionally, since you've been taking Clomid, it's possible",

The treatment for plantar fasciitis involves stretching the calf area, applying ice, taking several medications such as ibuprofen.  Seeing a physical therapist can also help.  Bone spurs are very common and in themselves do not usually cause pain.  Most of the pain from plantar fasciitis comes from the soft tissues. Sometimes for severe plantar fasciitis I will prescribe a night splint. Surgery is almost never indicated for this condition. As regards the neck issue, it sounds as though this might be soft tissue in origin, particularly if your x-rays are negative.  You could be experiencing mild muscle spasm or a simple strain of the soft tissues in the cervical region.  It might be a good idea to pay a visit to a physical therapist who can teach you some stretches and some exercises to do at home.

Gallstones can cause biliary colic, which is a type of abdominal pain that can radiate to the chest, back, and even the arms and legs. The pain can be exacerbated by eating fatty or greasy foods, which may be why you're experiencing it at night.\n\nSecondly, the difficulty bending over could be related to your weight loss and the loss of muscle mass. As you've lost a significant amount of weight, your body may not have the same level of muscle mass and strength as it used to, making it more challenging to perform activities that require bending or lifting.\n\nLastly, the pain you're experiencing after lifting at work could be related to a few factors. One possibility is that you're experiencing muscle strain or overuse, which is common when you're doing physical activities that you're not used to doing. Another possibility is that your gallstones are causing inflammation in your abdomen, which can radiate to your back and legs, causing pain.\n\nGiven your symptoms and medical",

This occurs due to excessive oil secretion by the oil glands on the face. One of the causes for this is excessive washing of the face.

The healing process may be slower, and it may take longer for the nerves to regenerate.\n\nHere are some general guidelines to expect:\n\n1. Initial recovery: In the first few weeks to months, you may experience some improvement in nerve function as the initial swelling and inflammation subsides. This is a critical period, and it's essential to continue with your therapy and follow-up care.\n2. Gradual improvement: Over the next 6-12 months, you may notice gradual improvement in nerve function, including increased sensation, strength, and range of motion.

It's great that you're finding ways to manage your symptoms and still get the nutrients you need.\n\nHowever, it's possible that the prolonged use of blended foods could be contributing to the issue with your gums not being sore. Here are a few potential reasons why:\n\n1. Lack of mechanical stimulation: When you chew your food, your jaw and facial muscles work together to break down the food into smaller pieces. This mechanical stimulation can help stimulate blood flow and keep the gums healthy. With blended foods, this mechanical stimulation is reduced, which might lead to reduced blood flow and potential gum issues.\n2. Reduced saliva production: When you eat solid foods, your body produces saliva to help break down the food and clean your mouth. Blended foods might not stimulate the same level of saliva production, which could lead to dry mouth and potentially contribute to gum issues.\n3.

Let's dive into the science behind using egg whites for burn treatment.\n\nThe idea of using egg whites to help heal burns dates back to the 19th century. The theory is that the protein-rich egg whites can help create a protective barrier on the burned skin, promoting wound healing and reducing the risk of infection. Some proponents claim that egg whites can even help reduce pain and inflammation.\n\nSeveral studies have investigated the effectiveness of egg whites in burn treatment. Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n1. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Burn Care & Research found that egg white protein dressings reduced bacterial growth and improved wound healing in rats with burns.\n2. Another study published in 2015 in the Journal of Surgical Research found that egg white protein dressings reduced inflammation and improved wound healing in mice with burns.\n3.

Avoid scratching or rubbing the area, as this can exacerbate the inflammation and potentially lead to infection.\n\nIt's also important to note that in rare cases, a yellow jacket sting can cause anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that requires immediate medical attention. If you experience any symptoms such as difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, or dizziness, seek emergency medical help.",

Angina typically presents with symptoms such as chest tightness, heaviness, or pressure, often accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, and lightheadedness. While you mentioned feeling pressure in your heart area, it's not accompanied by the typical anginal symptoms.\n\nThe burping you're experiencing to relieve pressure in your heart area is an interesting phenomenon. It's possible that you're experiencing some degree of esophageal compression or irritation, which could be related to your ASD (atrial septal defect). The pressure you're feeling might be caused by the abnormal blood flow or pressure gradient across the defect, which could be compressing or irritating the esophagus.\n\nThe fact that you're taking Vasotec (enalapril) and Triamterene for high blood pressure could also be contributing to the pressure sensation you're experiencing. These medications can cause vasodilation, which may lead to increased blood flow to the esophagus and potentially cause discomfort or pressure.\n\nIt's great that you're having an echo Doppler test tomorrow. This will help your doctor assess the severity of your ASD and any potential complications. In the meantime, I recommend speaking with your doctor about your",

If you notice any signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or pus, seek medical attention.\n2. **Apply ice**: Gently apply an ice pack or a cold compress to the affected area for 10-15 minutes, 2-3 times a day. This can help reduce swelling and ease discomfort.\n3. **Use a soft dressing**: If the bruise is painful or tender, you can apply a soft dressing or a band-aid to protect the area and provide additional support.\n4. **Encourage rest**: Make sure your daughter gets plenty of rest and takes it easy for the next few days.

Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation in the gut, but it may not be effective for everyone. I would recommend discussing this with your doctor to explore other treatment options.\n\nRegarding your symptoms, it's not uncommon for people with Crohn's disease to experience periods of flare-ups, which can be triggered by various factors such as stress, poor diet, or underlying infections. The severe left-sided pain, nausea, and vomiting you're experiencing could be indicative of a flare-up.\n\nTo help manage your symptoms, I would suggest the following:\n\n1. **Stay hydrated**: It's crucial to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration, which can exacerbate symptoms. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water per day. You can also try electrolyte-rich beverages like sports drinks or coconut water to help replenish lost electrolytes.\n2. **BRAT diet**: The BRAT diet (",

It sounds like you're experiencing a phenomenon that's often referred to as \"exercise-induced vasovagal response\" or \"post-exercise orthostatic intolerance.\" This is a common issue that occurs when the body's autonomic nervous system (ANS) responds to physical activity by slowing down the heart rate and blood pressure, leading to a temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain and other vital organs.\n\nThe symptoms you described, such as shortness of breath, lightheadedness, tingling in the fingers, and pale skin, are all consistent with this condition. The fact that it only happens after a period of inactivity and not when you're working out consistently suggests that your body is taking some time to adapt to the physical demands of exercise.\n\nHere are a few possible explanations for what might be happening:\n\n1. **Deconditioning:** When you're not used to exercising, your body may not be able to adapt quickly enough to the demands of physical activity, leading to a temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain and other vital organs.\n2. **Vasovagal response:** The vasovagal response is a normal physiological response to stress, including physical",

Betnovate-c and Delaware are not good options for fairness as they contain steroids and other contents which can badly damage your skin. For better complexion, use mild cream containing comic acid, soy isoflavones, albumin etc. on regular basis (Mel aglow). Use good quality water-based sunscreen regularly to avoid tanning and pigmentation due to sunlight. Use good moisturizer like Eocene to keep your skin well HY Chat Doctor. You can opt for simple office based procedures like chemical peeling, microdermabrasion, monotherapy etc. Use glycolic acid based face wash for gentle exfoliation of dead skin.

        "generated": "\n\nI'm a doctor, and I'd be happy to help you with your concerns!\n\nFirstly, let me clarify that Betnovate C and Melacare are not primarily used for skin whitening or fairness. They are topical corticosteroids and a skin lightening cream, respectively, but they have different purposes and may not be suitable for your concerns.\n\nBetnovate C is a corticosteroid cream used to treat various skin conditions such as eczema, dermatitis, and allergic reactions. It can help reduce inflammation and itching, but it is not a skin whitening agent.\n\nMelacare, on the other hand, is a skin lightening cream that contains a combination of ingredients to help reduce melanin production and even out skin tone. However, it's essential to note that skin lightening creams can have varying degrees of effectiveness, and they may not work for everyone.\n\nAs for your request for a fair complexion, I must emphasize that skin tone is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and it's not possible to change your natural skin tone with a cream alone. Additionally, using skin lightening creams can have potential risks, such as skin irritation, allergic reactions, and uneven skin tone.\n\nInstead, I recommend focusing on maintaining",

The fact that your pain is exacerbated by sitting for extended periods and improves with movement suggests that the tear may be causing mechanical irritation to the surrounding tissues.\n\nThe fact that your legs feel heavy and uncomfortable for the first few steps after sitting is likely due to the mechanical irritation causing inflammation and stiffness in the surrounding muscles and ligaments. The popping and snapping sensation in your low back with movement is likely due to the tear causing instability in the spine and joint movement.\n\nGiven that you've already tried injections with little to no relief, it's possible that the tear is not the primary source of your pain. The pain doctor's diagnosis of inflammation in the sacroiliac (SI) joint is an interesting one, as it's possible that the inflammation in the SI joint is contributing to your pain, especially since you reported some relief after the injections.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the pain is not solely coming from the SI joint and that there may be other contributing factors.

I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You should know that when we treat hypertension our goal is to keep mean blood pressure values below 140 / 90 mmHg. A person might have high value during emotional and physicals trees so It's mandatory to judge on mean values. Celesta is a very good blood pressure antihypertensive. Omega-3 it's not a treatment for blood pressure, it helps to lower your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have mean values below 140 / 90 mmHg than you are ok.the schema is ok. If you catch any high value than I would recommend a check up with a cardiac echo, a full blood analyze to check your renal function and a holder pressure monitoring to evaluate your values during day and night.

This is considered hypertension, and it's essential to manage it to prevent complications. Telmisartan (Telmade) is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) commonly used to treat hypertension. Solman Omega-3 is a supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, primarily EPA and DHA.\n\nCombining Telmade with Solman Omega-3:\n\n1. Telmade is an ARB, which can help lower blood pressure by blocking the action of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA, have anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects, which may complement the action of Telmade.\n2. Omega-3 supplements may also help reduce triglycerides, slow the growth of plaque in arteries, and reduce blood pressure.\n3. However, it's essential to note that omega-3 supplements should not replace standard medical therapy for hypertension. Telmade is a prescription medication that requires regular monitoring and adjustment to achieve optimal blood pressure control.\n\nWhen to consume Omega-3:\n\n1.

However, it's crucial to consider the possibility of ovarian cancer in women with a high-risk family history.\n\nGiven your wife's history of gastritis and the normal endoscopy results, it's essential to re-evaluate her symptoms and consider a more comprehensive evaluation.

Losing weight, especially in a short span of time, can be concerning. Given your current weight of 42 kg and height of 5'6\", your BMI is slightly underweight. As a mother, it's essential to maintain a healthy weight for your overall well-being and your baby's health.\n\nSince you've mentioned eating a lot of fruits and meals, it's great that you're consuming a balanced diet. However, it's possible that you might be losing weight due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Stress**: As you mentioned, you feel stressed every time. Chronic stress can lead to weight loss, as it increases cortisol levels, which can break down muscle tissue and reduce appetite.\n2. **Poor nutrient intake**: Although you're eating a lot of fruits and meals, it's possible that you're not consuming enough calories or nutrients to support your weight gain.\n3. **Lack of healthy fats**: Fruits are low in calories and healthy fats, which are essential for weight gain. You might need to include more sources of healthy fats like nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil",

It's not uncommon for women to experience changes in their menstrual cycle after removing an Implanon, especially if they've had a prolonged period of amenorrhea (no periods).\n\nFirstly, let's address your concern about not having a period yet. It's possible that your body is still adjusting to the removal of the Implanon, and it may take some time for your menstrual cycle to regulate. Hormonal fluctuations can cause irregular periods, and it's not uncommon for women to experience a delay in getting their period after removing a hormonal contraceptive like Implanon.\n\nHowever, if you're concerned about not having a period, I recommend speaking with your healthcare provider. They can perform a pelvic exam, take a pregnancy test, and check your hormone levels to rule out any underlying issues. If you're not pregnant, your healthcare provider may recommend a follow-up appointment to monitor your menstrual cycle and ensure it's returning to normal.\n\nRegarding the possibility of conceiving with an expired Implanon still in your arm, it's highly unlikely. Implanon is a progestin-only contraceptive, and its effectiveness decreases over time. Once the Implanon expires, its hormone levels drop significantly, making it less effective as a form of contraception",

An elevated eosinophil count can indicate an allergic response, which might be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nYour new diagnosis of allergic bronchitis by your current doctor is a plausible possibility. Allergic bronchitis is a condition where the airways become inflamed due to an allergic reaction, leading to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.\n\nThe symptoms you've described, such as coughing fits accompanied by itchiness in your chest and slimy, sticky mucus, are consistent with allergic",

A lot of people have it genetically predetermined, although parents may/may not have it. A frequent cause of non-genetic lip darkening is the use of lipsticks /colored balms/gloss, as these tend to darken the lips over a period of time. So try and not use it too often. If you have to use it, then let it be alleged free and replace them every 2 months. I would advise you to start using medicated lip balms with SPF and to reapply it several times in a day.that helps in reducing further darkening. Definite cream or any others having Comic acid can be used twice a day for lightening of lip color. It usually does not have side effects. However u can check for tolerance of the product by applying it for a short time on the first application. If you have a genetic tendency to dark lips, the pigmentation has chances of coming back after the cream is stopped. U can also opt for mild chemical peels once in 15-30 days to exfoliate better and lighten faster. Take care!",

Even though it needs clinical assessment for a diagnosis, from your history, it seems that you have inflammation/calculi in your gall bladder/biliary system giving rise to such intermittent severe pain. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to avoid fatty/oily food which would precipitate the pain more due to contraction of the gall bladder to empty bile into the intestines.  I would advise you a bland diet, some routine investigations like a CBC, a blood sugar, liver function test, a serum amylase and lipase to rule out associated pancreatitis, and an ultrasound abdomen to see the status of the biliary tree including the gall bladder to exclude a stone causing cholecystitis and also to know the status of the pancreas. Further management would depend on the result of clinical examination and reports of the related investigations. Till then, you could go for an anti-spasmodic along with a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

However, in some cases, antibiotics can help reduce the severity of the infection and promote healing.\n\nGiven your severe allergy to most antibiotics, we need to explore alternative options.

I would recommend consulting with an oral surgeon or a specialist in oral and maxillofacial surgery to evaluate the abscess and determine the best course of treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some steps you can take to manage your symptoms and reduce the risk of complications:\n\n1. Apply a warm compress to the affected area to help reduce swelling and ease pain.\n2. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times a day to reduce swelling and promote healing.\n3.",

As the pain in the knee is persisting a thorough assessment is needed. Due to ligament injuries within the knee joint, such types of pain can be expected. On a longer run, this ligament injuries if left untreated leads to early OA knee, that is the degenerative changes in the knee joint. Also, undergoing an MRI of the knee should help understand the soft tissues better and then you have to undergo physical therapy for 2-3 weeks post which you can follow the exercises at home itself. Any prevention in the early stages provides good results. In my clinical experience, early detection helps in early time and late detection cases responds slowly. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.",

Based on your description, I'll do my best to provide some insights.\n\nFirstly, it's impressive that you were able to get up quickly after the fall without significant pain at the time. This suggests that the initial injury might not have been as severe as you're experiencing now.\n\nThe pain you're describing, located under your right rib cage, is quite specific. It's possible that you may have injured a muscle or soft tissue in your abdominal wall, which could be causing the pain. The fact that it doesn't hurt when you breathe or walk suggests that it's not related to a more serious internal organ injury.\n\nGiven your description of the pain increasing to a 10 when you apply pressure, I'm concerned that you might have injured a structure called the quadratus lumborum (QL) muscle. This muscle is located in the lower back, just below the ribcage, and it helps to stabilize the spine. It's possible that the fall caused strain or even a tear in this muscle, leading to the referred pain you're experiencing.\n\nAnother possibility is that you might have injured the iliac crest, which is the bony prominence on the top of the hip bone.

I would advise you to repeat the ultrasonography to see whether the stone has passed into the bladder or not. If it is passed into the bladder, nothing to worry as this will easily pass from the bladder out of the body.

However, it's essential to continue drinking plenty of fluids to help the stone pass. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water per day.\n\nIf the stone doesn't pass within the next 7-10 days, or if you experience severe symptoms such as severe pain, nausea, vomiting, or difficulty urinating, you may need to consider further medical intervention.\n\nIn the meantime, you can consider taking some over-the-counter pain relievers like",

Since you've had regular periods, it's a good sign that your hormonal balance is normal, and ovulation is likely occurring.\n\nRegarding your history of medical abortions, it's essential to note that the risk of complications or reduced fertility is generally low. Medical abortions are considered a safe and effective method for terminating pregnancies.\n\nHowever, it's natural to have some concerns about the impact of previous abortions on your fertility. While two medical abortions may not significantly affect your ability to conceive, there are a few factors to consider:\n\n1. **Hormonal changes**: Medical abortions work by blocking progesterone, a hormone essential for maintaining pregnancy. This hormonal disruption might affect ovulation or implantation of a fertilized egg. However, this effect is usually temporary and resolves on its own.\n2. **Scarring**: In rare cases, medical abortions can cause scarring on the uterus or cervix, which might lead to complications during a future pregnancy. However, this is more likely to occur with surgical abortions or repeated medical abortions.\n3. **Cervical changes**: Medical abortions can cause cervical changes, which might affect the ability of sperm to reach the",

However, in your case, the radiation exposure from the mammogram and ultrasound is extremely low and unlikely to pose a significant risk to your future pregnancy.\n\nHere's a brief explanation:\n\n1. Mammogram radiation: The radiation dose from a mammogram is typically around 0.1-0.3 mGy (milligray), which is a very small amount. For comparison, the average person is exposed to around 2.4 mGy of natural radiation per year from the environment.\n2. Ultrasound radiation: Ultrasound machines do not use ionizing radiation like X-rays or CT scans. Instead, they use high-frequency sound waves to produce images. This means there is no radiation exposure from the ultrasound.\n\nThe American College of Radiology (ACR) and the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) have established guidelines for radiation exposure during pregnancy. According to these guidelines, the radiation dose from a mammogram and ultrasound is considered safe for both the mother and the developing fetus.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) also recommends that women can",

The enlarged prostate can cause bleeding, which can be detected in the urine.\n2. **Kidney stones**: The presence of two small stones in the lower calyces of your left kidney could also be contributing to the bleeding. Stones can cause bleeding when they move or become dislodged.\n3. **Urethral bleeding**: Another possibility is that the bleeding is coming from the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine out of the body. This could be due to inflammation, irritation, or trauma to the urethra.\n\nGiven your situation, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. **Follow-up with your doctor**: Schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss your",

Sudden onset involuntary gasp without any respiratory symptoms (cough, breathlessness, chest pain) is commonly due to stress and anxiety.

Based on your description, it's possible that you're experiencing a type of anxiety-related episode, such as a panic attack.\n\nPanic attacks are sudden, intense episodes of fear or discomfort that can cause physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, and shortness of breath. They can occur at any time, even when there's no apparent reason for them.\n\nThe fact that these episodes have happened only a few times and have been triggered by different locations (work and home) suggests that they might be related to anxiety rather than a specific environmental factor.\n\nSome possible triggers for panic attacks include:\n\n1. Stress: Work-related stress, personal stress, or other forms of stress can contribute to anxiety and panic attacks.\n2. Anxiety disorders: If you have an underlying anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or social anxiety disorder, you may be more prone to panic attacks.\n3. Hormonal changes: Hormonal fluctuations during menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause can trigger anxiety and panic attacks in some women.\n4. Other medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or heart conditions, can cause symptoms that resemble panic attacks.\n\n",

While running the heart rate detector may mistake your body vibrations and movements for heart beats and count them accordingly. Hence the heart rate may erroneously show a high reading. So you have to check whether it happens to you only or with everyone. Another thing that can be done is a treadmill test. It requires you to run on a treadmill, the speed of which increases gradually to a point till your heart rate reaches a target rate. This TMT test will continuously record your EKG while you are running so all aberrations and errors can be rules out. It will definitely show whether you really have a fast heart rate on exercising.

This is a normal response to physical activity, especially when you're pushing yourself to go faster.\n2. **Tachycardia**: A heart rate of 230 bpm is considered tachycardia, which is a common phenomenon during exercise.

This indicates that your body is able to adapt to the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients, and your heart rate returns to normal after the exercise has stopped.\n\nHowever, it's essential to monitor your overall health and well-being, especially as you age.

If your pregnancy test is faint positive, and you are spotting, the first diagnosis to be looked for is pregnancy outside the uterine cavity (ectopic pregnancy). Do you have pain in the abdomen also? This is a very serious condition which lands into life-threatening bleeding emergencies requiring blood transfusion and surgical intervention to save the life. Please report to your Gynecologist for due assessment of the condition. You may have to undergo Laparoscopy for diagnosis or certain clinical tests can diagnose this condition. Please do not waste time. Rush to The Gynecologist ASAP. Take care please.",

Let's break down the possibilities:\n\n1. **Faint positive HPT:** A faint positive HPT can be due to several factors, including:\n\t* Early pregnancy (as you're suspecting)\n\t* Evaporation lines (false positives) from a previous test\n\t* Hormonal fluctuations (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders)\n\t* Certain medications (e.g., antidepressants, blood thinners)\n2. **Negative blood test:** A negative blood test usually indicates that there's no detectable human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your blood, which is a hormone produced during pregnancy. However, it's possible that the blood test was taken too early or that the levels of hCG were too low to detect.\n3. **Spotting:** Spotting during the early stages of pregnancy is common, especially around the time of implantation (around 6-12 days after fertilization). It's also possible that the spotting is due to other factors, such as hormonal changes",

A granuloma is a small, red, inflamed area that forms as a result of the body's natural healing process. It's usually caused by the irritation or inflammation of the surrounding tissues.\n\nThe fact that the sore was initially long and has now developed into a small, red dot suggests that the area is healing, but the inflammation has become localized to a specific point.

It's understandable that you're worried about the recent changes in your stool and the possibility of the chemotherapy irritating the lining of your intestine.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that Ixempra is a powerful chemotherapy agent that can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including changes in bowel habits and bleeding.\n\nThe symptoms you're experiencing, such as blood in the stool, mucous, and a lining-like appearance, are concerning. The fact that you've never experienced this before, despite being on different chemotherapies for 7 years, suggests that this may be a new development related to the current treatment.\n\nThe bloody stool you experienced today, accompanied by gas and a change in bowel habits, is a significant concern. It's possible that the chemotherapy is causing inflammation and irritation in the lining of your intestine, leading to bleeding and changes in bowel habits.\n\nGiven your symptoms, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Consult with your oncologist: It's crucial to discuss your symptoms with your oncologist and get their input on the possible causes and potential next steps. They may want to adjust your chemotherapy regimen or prescribe additional medications to manage the symptoms.\n2. Colonoscopy: I would recommend scheduling a colonoscopy",

Do not worry much about these aspects because such worries could boomerang into anxiety disorders. If you still need my assistance in this regard, please use this link. http",
        "generated": "\n\nI understand your question, and I'm happy to help you with your concerns!\n\nFirstly, it's completely normal to have questions and curiosities about sex, especially if you're a first-timer. It's great that you're taking the time to educate yourself and prepare for your first sexual experience.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n\n1. Bleeding from the penis during or after first sex:\n\nIt's possible to experience some bleeding or spotting after your first sexual encounter, but it's not a common occurrence. This can happen due to various reasons such as:\n\n* Minor tears in the skin of the penis\n* Friction or irritation during sex\n* Infection or inflammation (rarely)\n\nHowever, if you experience heavy bleeding, severe pain, or difficulty urinating after sex, you should seek medical attention. It's essential to prioritize your health and well-being.\n\n2. Breakage of the foreskin during sex:\n\nThe foreskin is a piece of skin that covers the head of the penis. In most cases, it's attached to the penis and can retract (move back) during sex. However, it's rare for the foreskin to break or tear during sex, especially if you're having sex with a partner who is gentle and respectful.\n\nIf you",

Cause of the health problems you queried-There are many causes of the lumps on your right knee after the recent fall. To rule out other causes, I would advise you to consult ER surgeon, who would examine it and treat it accordingly. Still with my expertise and experience, I would suggest you to rule out following causes with your ER OrthoSurgeon. Cause in your case-As the lump is of 2 1/2 weeks duration after review of your query data, it seems to be due to either of the following reasons--Post-traumatic Hematoma with traumatic swelling-which is in process of recovery and may take another 2-3 weeks.-If it doesn't settle after 4-6 weeks, Pre-Patellar Bursitis(Housemaids Knee)-post-traumatic needs to be ruled out. Both above possibilities needs to be ruled as only discomfort is felt by you while walking. In the absence of more information, I would advise Second opinion in your case, who would examine it and investigate it to treat it as per the cause of the lump. So I would advise you to consult ER OrthoSurgeon, who would rule out other causes of such a lump and would help you out with the fist hand information.

        "generated": "\n\nBased on your description, it's possible that the lump on your knee is a hematoma, which is a collection of blood that has accumulated in the soft tissues of your knee. This can occur when you fall and the blood vessels in your knee are damaged, causing bleeding into the surrounding tissue.\n\nSince the bruising has resolved, the hematoma may have become encapsulated, which is a common occurrence. The lump may be painful to the touch due to the pressure on the surrounding tissue and the potential for scar tissue to form.\n\nOther possible causes of the lump could include:\n\n1. Gout: A type of inflammatory arthritis that can cause painful joints, including the knee. Gout can cause a lump or swelling on the knee, especially if you have a history of gout or other inflammatory conditions.\n2. Baker's cyst: A type of fluid-filled sac that can develop behind the knee, usually due to inflammation or injury. Baker's cysts can cause a lump or swelling on the knee, and may be painful if pressed.\n3.

It's understandable that you're concerned about the wart on your buttocks, especially since it appeared shortly after giving birth.\n\nWarts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a common virus that can be spread through skin-to-skin contact, contaminated surfaces, or even through sexual contact. The wart on your buttocks is likely caused by the HPV virus, which is why it appeared after giving birth.\n\nAs for removing the wart, I must advise you against cutting it yourself, as this can lead to further complications, such as infection, scarring, or even spreading the virus to other areas of your body.\n\nInstead, there are several home remedies and over-the-counter treatments that you can try to help remove the wart. Here are a few options:\n\n1. Salicylic acid: You can purchase salicylic acid-based products, such as Compound W or Duofilm, which can help dissolve the keratin protein that makes up the wart.

It's usually benign and can be felt as a small, hard mass, often on the left side of the chest, near the sternum.\n* Costochondral tumor: This is a rare condition where a benign tumor develops in the costochondral junction, which is the area where the ribs meet the sternum. It can cause a lump or swelling in this area.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, it would be best to consult with a doctor, preferably a primary care physician or a specialist such as a thoracic surgeon or a radiologist. They may recommend the following:\n\n1. Physical examination: Your doctor will examine the lump and surrounding area to assess its size, shape, and consistency.\n2. Imaging tests: Your doctor may order imaging tests such as a chest X-ray, CT scan, or MRI to get a better view of the lump and its location.\n3.

I'm happy to help you understand the role of Clomid and Progynova in increasing your chances of conception.\n\nClomid (clomiphene citrate) is an ovulation-inducing medication that works by blocking the negative feedback effect of estrogen on the pituitary gland. This increases the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates the growth and maturation of follicles in the ovaries. Clomid is commonly used to induce ovulation in women with ovulation disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or unexplained infertility.\n\nProgynova (estradiol valerate) is a hormone replacement therapy medication that is used to treat hormonal imbalances, including those related to infertility. In your case, it's likely being prescribed to help regulate your menstrual cycle and improve ovulation.\n\nNow, regarding the effectiveness of Clomid and Progynova in increasing your chances of conception:\n\n1.

A lump in the inguinal region can simply be due to inflammation of the lymph nodes over there due to some infection. Spotting is not due to these lumps. Do not neglect your diet. Have regular diets. You see anxiety is an ailment which can be overcome very easily. Try relaxation techniques like consciously breathing in and out twice a day for 5 minutes. It will help you to relax. Every night before going to sleep write out 3 things that went well that day, it can be anything like you read a good story book, or you helped someone in the street, cooked a delicious dish just anything.

Given your history of trampoline park activity, I'm going to take a closer look at the possible causes:\n\n1. **Costochondritis**: This is an inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone. It can cause sharp, stabbing pains in the chest and upper back, especially with deep breathing or movement. Since you have a pigeon chest, this condition might be more likely to occur.\n2. **Rib strain or bruising**: The intense activity on the trampoline could have caused strain or bruising to the ribs, leading to pain in the chest and upper back.\n3. **Pectus excavatum-related issues**: Your pigeon chest might be contributing to the pain you're experiencing. The deformity can cause compression of the lungs, heart, and major blood vessels, leading to discomfort and pain.\n\nTo help alleviate your symptoms, I recommend the following",

The clots might be breaking off and traveling to your arms, causing the lumps and bruises.\n2. **Hormonal Changes**: Hormonal fluctuations, particularly during the menstrual cycle, can lead to changes in blood vessel tone, causing bruising and swelling.

If you're experiencing any hormonal changes, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid disorders, this could contribute to your symptoms.\n3. **Vitamin Deficiencies**: Deficiencies in vitamins like vitamin K, vitamin C, or vitamin E can affect blood clotting and cause bruising.

A pediatrician can assess your son's overall health, review his medical history, and provide guidance on managing his symptoms.\n\nSome questions to ask your pediatrician during the consultation:\n\n1. What could be the underlying cause of your son's allergy-like symptoms?\n2. Is it possible that the Fluzet syrup is masking the symptoms, or is it truly providing relief?\n3. Are there any other potential allergens or triggers that we should be",

Continue taking Advil as directed to manage your pain. However, be sure to follow the recommended dosage and consult with a doctor before taking it for an extended period.\n2.

The symptoms you're describing, such as a dark, fresh bruise and swelling around the ankle bone, could be related to a few possible causes.\n\nHere are a few potential explanations:\n\n1. **Peroneal nerve compression**: Due to your hypermobile joints and EDS, the peroneal nerve, which runs along the outside of the ankle, might be compressed or irritated, leading to bruising and swelling. This could be caused by repetitive stress or strain from standing for long periods.\n2. **Ligamentous laxity**: EDS can cause laxity (looseness) in the ligaments, which can lead to joint instability and subsequent bruising or swelling. In your case, the swelling around the ankle bone might be due to ligamentous laxity.\n3. **Poor circulation**: EDS can also affect blood vessel walls, leading to poor circulation and bruising. This could be exacerbated by prolonged standing,",

A hard lump at the fracture site 14 months after the initial injury is not uncommon, and it could be related to calcium deposits. However, it's essential to get a proper evaluation to determine the exact cause of the lump.\n\nCalcium deposits, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO), can occur in areas of the body where bone is not normally present, such as at the fracture site. HO is a common complication after trauma, including fractures. It's thought to occur due to the activation of bone-forming cells, which can lead to the deposition of calcium and other minerals.\n\nIn your case, the lump could be due to calcium deposits, but it's also possible that it could be caused by other factors, such as:\n\n1. Osteophyte formation: Osteophytes are small, bony growths that can develop at the edges of joints or at the site of previous injuries.\n2.

Breakthrough bleeding can occur due to changes in hormone levels, which can cause the uterus to shed some of its lining. This bleeding is usually lighter and shorter than a regular period.\n2. **Withdrawal bleeding**: Another possibility is that you're experiencing withdrawal bleeding, which is a temporary bleeding that occurs when the body adjusts to the new hormone levels. This is more common in the first few months of taking the pill.\n3. **Spotting**: It's also possible that the bleeding is just spotting, which is light bleeding that can occur due to hormonal changes or other factors.\n\nTo alleviate your concerns, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Contact your OB**: Reach out to your OB and discuss your concerns with her.

This can put pressure on nearby nerves, muscles, and other structures in the thoracic spine.\n\nNow, regarding the symptom of shortness of breath, it's true that some people with thoracic bulging disks may experience respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath, due to various mechanisms:\n\n1. **Nerve compression**: Compression of the nerves in the thoracic spine can cause referred pain and numbness in the chest and shoulders, which may be misinterpreted as shortness of breath.\n2. **Muscle strain**: Strained muscles in the thoracic region can cause respiratory muscle fatigue, leading to shortness of breath.\n3. **Referral of pain**: The thoracic spine can refer pain to the chest, which may be perceived as shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that shortness of breath is not a typical symptom",

It's a common and effective treatment for tubal blockage.\n\n2. If your blockage is removed during the laparoscopy, it's possible that you may be able to get pregnant naturally. However, it's essential to note that the success rate of getting pregnant after tubal reversal surgery is not 100%. It depends on various factors such as the severity of the blockage, the age of the woman, and the overall health of the couple.\n\n3. As for precautions, it's essential to follow your doctor's instructions carefully after the surgery. You may need to take pain medication, antibiotics, and other medications as prescribed. You should also avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities for a few weeks after the surgery. Additionally, you should avoid sexual intercourse for 4-6 weeks after the surgery to allow the incisions to heal.\n\n4. Having one tube does not necessarily mean that you cannot get pregnant naturally. However, the success rate of getting pregnant with one tube is lower compared to having two tubes.

Consult with your primary care physician or a general surgeon to evaluate the possibility of a hernia recurrence or new hernia on the left side.

If the pain persists, your doctor may also recommend a urology evaluation to rule out any urinary tract issues, such as a kidney stone or infection.\n3.

It's essential to acknowledge that your friend was struggling with deep-seated issues, and your comment, although unintentional, might have been a trigger, but it wasn't the sole cause of their death.\n\nRegarding your stress and anxiety, it's crucial to address these feelings to prevent them from escalating. Here are some suggestions that might help:\n\n1. **Talk to someone**: Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. Sharing your feelings with someone who cares about you can help you process your emotions and gain a different perspective.\n2. **Seek professional help**: Consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in grief, trauma, or anxiety. They can provide you with a safe and non-judgmental space to explore your feelings and develop coping strategies.\n",

In cases like yours with an ankle sprain and then continued pain, it is most likely that there was some soft tissue damage on the structures that support the ankle joint itself. There is a ligament and two tendons on the outside of the ankle that are the main stabilizers, and these structures can get stretched, partially torn, or completely torn with a sprain. Most times, these will scar back down and continue to support the ankle. Other times, they will not be able to do the job as they did before and will have to work \\\"overtime\\\" to do the same job. This area then gets inflamed and painful, especially after a full day of trying to stabilize the joint (being on the feet all day). It is wise to start out with an ankle brace and see if that helps the area, as the brace can do the job of these soft tissue structures and give them a break to help decrease inflammation/pain. I hope this answer helped, if you have any further questions, I am here to help. Thank you.",

How long do these lesions typically last before they heal or fall off?\n3. Are there any triggers that seem to exacerbate your symptoms, such as certain foods, environmental factors, or stress?\n4. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these lesions, such as fever, chills, or joint pain?\n5. Have you tried any topical creams, ointments, or oral medications that have shown some improvement, no matter how small?\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to ask about your medical history, including any previous allergies, skin conditions, or autoimmune disorders.

It's great that you've been taking steps to incorporate physical activity into your routine, and it's even more impressive that you've been consistent with treadmill walking.\n\nRegarding your symptoms, I understand that you're experiencing abdominal pain, which is concerning. Since you've already undergone various tests, including stomach scanning, X-ray, and blood tests, and the results are normal, it's likely that the pain is not related to any underlying organic issue.\n\nGiven your symptoms, I'd like to consider a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Muscle strain**: It's possible that you've developed muscle strain or overuse syndrome in your abdominal muscles, thighs, hips, and back due to the sudden increase in physical activity. This can cause pain and stiffness, especially with movement.\n2. **Poor posture or biomechanics**: As you start walking, your body may be adjusting to new movements, which can lead to poor posture or biomechanics. This can put strain on your abdominal muscles, leading to pain.\n3. **Lack of core strength**: As a non-athlete, your core muscles might not be as strong as they need to be to support your new physical activities. This can lead to fatigue",

While surgery is often the most effective way to remove a mass or polyp, there are some alternative options and considerations that can be explored.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that the mass you're referring to is likely a type of fluid-filled cyst or a polyp that's causing symptoms. The fact that it responded to treatment with methylprednisone and zithromax suggests that it may be an inflammatory or infectious process.\n\nBefore considering surgery, your doctor may want to try to manage the symptoms and reduce the size of the mass through medical therapy. This could include:\n\n1. Corticosteroids: Methylprednisone can help reduce inflammation and swelling, which may shrink the mass.\n2. Antibiotics: Zithromax may be effective in treating any underlying infection.\n3. Nasal decongestants: Medications like oxymetazoline can help reduce nasal congestion and swelling.\n4. Saline nasal sprays: Rinsing the nasal passages with a saline solution can help clear out mucus and reduce inflammation.\n\nIt's also important to consider the following factors before",

They can recommend a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods to help her regain strength and improve her overall health.\n2. **Introduce a liquid diet**: While ice cream and ice chips are not ideal, a liquid diet can be a good starting point.

As you've been referred to a cardiologist and wear an internal heart monitor, I'll focus on the potential hereditary neurological factors that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nGiven your family history, it's possible that you may be experiencing symptoms related to a hereditary neurological condition. Here are a few possibilities to consider:\n\n1. **Neurocardiogenic Syncope**: This condition is characterized by fainting episodes triggered by changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or vasovagal responses. It's more common in women, but it can occur in men as well. Since you have a slow pulse, which can be a contributing factor to neurocardiogenic syncope, this condition might be worth exploring.\n2. **Autonomic Dysfunction**: Autonomic dysfunction refers to abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system, which regulates various bodily functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. This condition can cause symptoms like fainting, dizziness, and changes in heart rate. Given your family history, it's possible that you may have an inherited predisposition to autonomic dysfunction.\n3. **Mitochondrial Diseases**: Mitochondrial diseases are a group of disorders that affect the mitochondria, the",

The goal of treatment is to slow down the progression of CKD and manage symptoms.\n\nMedications that can help reduce urea and creatinine levels include:\n\n1. ACE inhibitors or ARBs: These medications can help slow down the progression of CKD by reducing proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) and blood pressure.\n2.

Monitor the lipomas for any changes in size, shape, or number, and schedule follow-up appointments as needed.\n2. **Steroid injections**: Corticosteroid injections can help reduce the size of lipomas. The injections contain a mild steroid that helps shrink the fatty tissue in the lipoma. This treatment is generally effective for small to moderate-sized lipomas.\n3. **Surgical excision**: For larger or symptomatic lipomas, surgical excision is a viable option.

This is usually due to the nerve endings being affected during the procedure. The good news is that this sensitivity should improve over time.\n\nFor your immediate concerns, here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **Apply a topical anesthetic cream**: You can try applying a topical anesthetic cream, such as lidocaine or benzocaine, to the affected area. This can help numb the area and reduce sensitivity. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for a recommendation on which cream to use and how to apply it.\n2. **Use a barrier cream**: Applying a barrier cream, such as petroleum jelly or a hydrocortisone cream, can help protect the glans area from irritation and friction caused by clothing. This can help reduce discomfort when walking or engaging in activities.\n3. **Wear loose, comfortable clothing**: Avoid tight-fitting clothing, especially boxers, that may rub against the sensitive area. Opt for loose, breathable clothing that won't irritate the area.\n4. **Take warm baths or",

The symptoms you're experiencing, such as difficulty walking for more than 2 hours and erectile dysfunction, are likely related to the aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aortic valve). This condition can lead to decreased blood flow to the legs, which can cause fatigue and shortness of breath during physical activity.\n\nAfter the surgery, you can expect to experience significant improvements in your symptoms. The new valve will allow for more efficient blood flow, reducing the pressure on your heart and increasing the amount of oxygen-rich blood that reaches your muscles. This should enable you to walk for longer periods without feeling fatigued.\n\nAs for the erectile dysfunction, it's common for men to experience some degree of impotence after aortic valve replacement surgery. However, many men are able to regain normal sexual function within 6-12 months after surgery. Factors such as age, overall health, and the type of surgery used can influence the likelihood of regaining normal sexual function.\n\nNow, regarding your question about American hospitals in Thailand that offer medical tourism services, there are several options to consider:\n\n1.

High blood pressure can cause a range of symptoms, including fatigue, due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Increased workload on the heart: High blood pressure requires your heart to work harder to pump blood throughout your body, leading to increased oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. This can result in feelings of fatigue.\n2. Decreased blood flow: High blood pressure can cause blood vessels to constrict, reducing blood flow to various parts of the body, including the brain, muscles, and organs. This reduced blood flow can lead to feelings of fatigue and exhaustion.\n3.

If you're experiencing persistent chest tightness, it's crucial to discuss this with your cardiologist to rule out any potential complications or concerns.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general recommendations that may help alleviate your symptoms:\n\n1. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption: Try to limit or avoid drinking alcohol for a while to see if your symptoms improve.\n2. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to help flush out your system and reduce the effects of alcohol",

I'll provide you with some general information, but please consult a medical professional for personalized advice.\n\nBased on your husband's condition, having seminal vas deference but with lots of sperm in his testis, it seems like he may have a condition called obstructive azoospermia. This means that there is a blockage in the vas deferens, which prevents the sperm from being released during ejaculation.\n\nRegarding your situation, it's concerning that you've had multiple failed treatments for PCOS and have experienced miscarriages. However, it's great that you've had some positive results, such as the 177 beta hCG level after the second treatment.\n\nTo determine your chances of conceiving, we would need to discuss your individual situation in more detail. However, I can provide some general information about PCOS and fertility.\n\nPCOS is a common hormonal disorder that affects ovulation, making it challenging to conceive. Women with PCOS often experience irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and hormonal imbalances. The success rate of fertility treatments for PCOS depends on various factors, including the severity of the condition, the woman's age, and the quality of the eggs.\n\n",

It seems that you are having repetitive thoughts regarding the same, and you understand such thoughts are irrational. Such thoughts can be termed as obsessions and the repeated cleaning or washing in response to the thoughts can be termed compulsions. Obsessive compulsive disorder is a type of anxiety disorder which is not uncommon.

I would suggest you seek a psychiatric consultation for detailed evaluation of your symptoms and starting proper treatment. Your condition can be treated effectively with medications like fluoxetine or sertraline (one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). You will have to be patient about the response as the medicines will take at least 10-15 days to show its effect. The treatment will be long term, and you will need regular follow-ups.

However, the fact that both arms are affected and the temperature difference is significant is worth investigating.\n\nThere are a few possible explanations for this phenomenon:\n\n1. **Anesthetic-related vasodilation**: The anesthetic agents used during surgery can cause blood vessels to dilate, leading to increased blood flow and warmth in the affected areas. This is usually temporary and should resolve on its own within a few days.\n2. **Increased sympathetic nervous system activity**: The surgical procedure can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increased blood flow and warmth in the arms. This is a common phenomenon, especially in the upper extremities.\n3. **Other possible causes**: Although less likely, it's possible that the warmth and redness could be related to an underlying condition, such as:\n\t* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): A blood clot in the deep veins of the arm, which could cause warmth, redness, and swelling.\n\t* Lymphedema: A condition characterized by abnormal accumulation of lymph fluid, which can cause swelling, warmth, and redness",

It's great that you're proactive about your health and exercise regularly.\n\nEosinophilia Allergy is an immune system reaction that can cause symptoms like hives, itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing. Since your symptoms are triggered by cold seasons, it's likely related to environmental allergens like pollen, mold, or cold air.\n\nHere are some natural and home remedies that may help alleviate your symptoms:\n\n1. **Neti Pot**: Rinse your nasal passages with a saline solution using a neti pot. This can help remove allergens and reduce congestion.\n2. **Local Honey**: Consume local, raw honey that contains small amounts of the same pollen that triggers your allergy. This can help desensitize you to local allergens.\n3. **Quercetin**: This natural antihistamine can be found in foods like apples, onions, and garlic. You can also take it as a supplement after consulting with your doctor.\n4. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: These anti-inflammatory fatty acids can be found in fatty fish, flaxseeds, or walnuts.

The phenomenon you're describing is commonly known as \"pre-ejaculate\" or \"pre-cum.\" It's a natural response to sexual arousal, and it's not uncommon for it to occur during phone conversations or in-person interactions.\n\nThe pre-ejaculate you're experiencing is a clear, thick liquid that's produced by the Cowper's glands, which are located near the prostate gland. This fluid helps to lubricate the penis and may also contain sperm, which can increase the chances of conception. The frequency of pre-ejaculate you're experiencing (3-4 times a day and night) is not unusual, especially if you're experiencing high levels of sexual arousal.\n\nAs for the diet aspect, there isn't a specific diet that can completely eliminate pre-ejaculate. However, a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients can help regulate your hormonal balance and overall sexual health. Here are some general dietary recommendations that may help:\n\n1. Increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids: These healthy fats can help",

It's common to feel more tired during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. However, if you're taking your vitamins and eating well, it's possible that there might be an underlying issue.\n\nThe symptom that's concerning me the most is the palpable pulse in your ear when you stand up. This could be a sign of a condition called supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which is a type of abnormal heart rhythm. During pregnancy, the heart rate can increase due to hormonal changes, but if you're experiencing a palpable pulse in your ear, it's essential to get it checked out.\n\nAdditionally, being short of breath when walking up the stairs is another red flag. This could be related to the increased blood volume and pressure on your lungs, but it's also possible that there's an underlying issue with your cardiovascular system.\n\nI would recommend scheduling an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss these symptoms further. They will likely perform a physical examination, take your medical history, and possibly order some tests to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general tips that might help alleviate your symptoms:\n\n1",

If so, you need to consult your dentist for infection. It can also be the part of normal healing process, so wait and watch for 1-2 weeks. Maintain oral hygiene.

        "generated": "\n\nI understand your concern. A yellow spot on your gum can be unsettling, especially after recent gum surgery and veneers placement. Let's go through some possible explanations:\n\n1. **Gingival inflammation**: It's possible that the yellow spot is an area of inflammation or swelling due to the recent gum surgery. This inflammation can cause discoloration, but it's usually accompanied by redness, swelling, and tenderness. Since you mentioned it's not painful or sensitive, it's less likely to be an inflammatory response.\n2. **Gum tissue reaction to veneers**: The new veneers may be causing a reaction in the gum tissue, leading to discoloration. This is more likely if the veneers are not properly fitted or if there's an allergic reaction to the materials used. However, if the veneers are properly placed and you're not experiencing any discomfort, this might not be the primary cause.\n3. **Dental calculus or tartar**: It's possible that the yellow spot is actually a buildup of dental calculus or tartar beneath the gumline. This can occur when plaque and bacteria accumulate and harden, causing discoloration. However, this would typically be accompanied by other symptoms like bad breath, bleeding gums, or sensitivity.\n4",

However, it's understandable that your son's symptoms persist despite treatment.\n\nGiven the diagnosis of an allergy as the underlying cause, it's possible that the cough is not directly related to the allergy, but rather a secondary symptom. Coughs can be caused by a variety of factors, including postnasal drip, bronchitis, or even acid reflux.\n\nSince your son has not responded to treatment, I'd like to ask a few more questions to help narrow down the possible causes:\n\n1. What are the specific symptoms your son is experiencing? Is the cough persistent, or does it come and go? Is it dry, wet, or productive (bringing up mucus)?\n2. Are there any other symptoms your son is experiencing, such as congestion, sinus pressure, or sore throat?\n3. Has your son's cough changed in any way over the past 10 days? For example, has it become more severe, or is it more frequent?\n4. Are there any triggers that seem to make the cough worse?

Based on your description, it's possible that the lump could be a lipoma, which is a benign (non-cancerous) growth made up of fatty tissue. Lipomas are relatively common and typically don't cause any symptoms, including pain.\n\nSince you mentioned that the lump is not painful and you didn't notice it until you saw that your arm looked a bit larger, it's likely that the lump has been present for some time and has grown slowly over the years.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to have any new or changing lump evaluated by a healthcare professional to rule out any other possible causes. I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a primary care physician or a dermatologist to have the lump examined.\n\nDuring the examination, the doctor will likely use a combination of visual inspection, palpation (feeling the lump with their hands), and possibly imaging tests (such as ultrasound or MRI) to determine the size, shape, and consistency of the lump. They may also take a biopsy (remove a small sample of tissue) to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to keep an eye on the lump and see if it changes size or shape over time. If you experience any new or worsening",
