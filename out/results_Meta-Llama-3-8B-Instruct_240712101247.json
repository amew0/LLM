As a doctor, I'd like to address your questions and provide some reassurance.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you had a cervical biopsy in 2010 and the results were normal. However, the symptoms you're experiencing now are concerning, and we should investigate further.\n\nThe bloating you're describing, which resembles a 2-3 month pregnancy, is not a typical symptom of ovarian cancer. While ovarian cancer can cause bloating, it's often accompanied by other symptoms like abdominal pain, pelvic pain, or changes in bowel habits.\n\nGiven your age, 29, and the absence of other symptoms, it's unlikely that ovarian cancer is the primary cause of your bloating. Ovarian cancer is relatively rare, and it's more common in women over 50.\n\nA more plausible explanation for your bloating could be related to hormonal changes or other non-cancerous causes. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Hormonal fluctuations: As a woman, you may be experiencing normal hormonal fluctuations, which can cause bloating, fatigue, and weight gain.\n2. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a common condition that can cause hormonal imbalances, leading to weight",

It's possible that the initial knot was a precursor to a more widespread skin condition.\n\nThe fact that your doctor put you on infection meds and you took them all without seeing any improvement suggests that the knot may not be caused by an infection. However, it's possible that the knot is caused by a skin condition that is not responding to antibiotics.\n\nGiven that you've taken allergy meds and the knot is still present, it's unlikely that the knot is caused by an allergic reaction.\n\nIt's important to see a doctor again to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, you may want to try applying a warm compress to the affected area to see if it helps to reduce the size and swelling of the knot",

As you mentioned, smoke exposure can trigger cold and asthma symptoms, which can be quite debilitating. To manage your condition, I recommend the following precautions:\n\n1. **Avoid smoke exposure**: Try to stay away from areas where smoke is present, such as cigarette smoke, fireplaces, or cooking with gas stoves. If you must be around smoke, wear a mask to filter out the particles.\n2. **Use your inhaler correctly**: Make sure you're using your inhaler correctly, as prescribed by your doctor. This will help you manage your symptoms effectively.\n3. **Keep your environment clean**: Regularly clean your living space, especially areas where smoke may accumulate, such as carpets and upholstery. This will help reduce the amount of particulate matter in the air.\n4. **Consider air purification**: Consider investing in an air purifier, which can help remove particulate matter and other pollutants from the air.\n5. **Monitor your symptoms**: Keep track of your symptoms, including frequency, severity, and duration.

However, please consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\nValium is a benzodiazepine medication that works by enhancing the activity of a neurotransmitter called GABA, which helps to calm the brain and body. It is typically prescribed to treat anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasms.\n\nYou're right that Valium is supposed to work quickly, often within 30 minutes to an hour after taking it. However, it's common for the body to develop tolerance to benzodiazepines, which means that the medication may become less effective over time.\n\nIn your case, it's possible that your body has developed tolerance to the 5mg dose of Valium, which is why you're experiencing increased anxiety and needing higher doses to manage your symptoms. This is a common phenomenon with benzodiazepines.\n\nAs for the idea that taking Valium daily can help it become more effective, there is some truth to this. When taken regularly, benzodiazepines can lead to a phenomenon called \"steady-state\" levels, where the medication reaches a consistent and predictable level in the bloodstream. This can make it easier to manage symptoms",

The fundus is the upper portion of the stomach, near the esophagus.\n\nThe radiologist is providing a nuanced interpretation of the finding, suggesting that it could be related to incomplete distention, which means that the stomach may not have been fully distended (stretched) during the CT scan. This could be due to various factors, such as the patient's position during the scan or the timing of the scan in relation to food intake.\n\nHowever, the radiologist is also not excluding the possibility of an underlying inflammatory or neoplastic process. This means that they are considering the possibility that the thickened stomach wall could be caused by inflammation (e.g., gastritis), infection (e.g., gastroenteritis), or even a tumor (neoplasm).\n\nGiven your symptoms of consistent pain in your upper abdomen, right of center at the rib, it's possible that the radiologist is trying to highlight the potential for a more serious underlying condition.

The fact that the pain is exacerbated by movement, walking, and even sleeping suggests that the clot may be causing a significant amount of discomfort.\n\nIt's possible that the blood clot has migrated or broken loose, causing the symptoms you're experiencing in your buttock. This is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.\n\nI would recommend that you contact your healthcare provider or return to the hospital as soon as possible to report these new symptoms. They may need to perform additional imaging tests, such as a CT or MRI scan, to determine the extent of the clot and assess any potential complications.\n\nIn the meantime, you may want to take the following precautions to reduce the risk of further complications:\n\n1. Elevate your legs above the level of your heart to reduce swelling.\n2. Avoid putting pressure or weight on the affected area.\n3.

Typically, women are advised to start birth control pills within seven days of their last menstrual period because it is unlikely that she would've already ovulated at that time.

Therefore, waiting seven days before having unprotected intercourse most likely was enough time to ensure that you would not become pregnant.

Fatigue: Despite getting 8 hours of sleep, you're still feeling tired. This could be related to an underlying medical condition or a hormonal imbalance.\n2. Headaches: Frequent headaches can be a sign of various issues, including dehydration, stress, or underlying medical conditions like migraines or sinusitis.\n3.

Bone spurs are natural growths of calcium along bone prominence areas. I see these spurs and I counsel my patient to try anti-inflammatories to reduce the pain. There are no medications or natural remedies that help dissolve the spur. Sometimes if the spur reduces the range of motion or cause significant pain then surgery to remove the spur is suggested. Hope this answers your question. Please contact us again with your questions.",

Wrist bone spurs, also known as osteophytes, are typically caused by wear and tear, inflammation, or underlying conditions such as osteoarthritis. In most cases, they require more comprehensive treatment to alleviate symptoms and promote healing.\n\nThe approach you've described, which includes daily calcium intake, 10-minute sun exposure, ice application, and turmeric and ginger supplements, may provide some minor benefits, such as:\n\n1. Calcium intake: May help maintain bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.\n2. Vitamin D from sun exposure: May help with calcium absorption and overall bone health.\n3. Ice application: May provide temporary pain relief and reduce inflammation.\n4. Turmeric and ginger: May have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which could help alleviate symptoms.\n\nHowever, this approach is unlikely to effectively treat the bone spur itself or address the underlying causes of the condition. Wrist bone spurs often require more targeted treatment, such as:\n\n1. Physical therapy: To improve range of motion, strength, and flexibility.\n2.

Here's a breakdown of each component:\n\nIchthammol ointment:\nIchthammol is a topical ointment containing ammonium bitumen, a type of coal tar derivative. It has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antifungal properties, which can help reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, and promote healing. Ichthammol ointment is often used to treat skin conditions such as eczema, acne, and minor wounds. In the context of cellulitis, it may help reduce swelling, pain, and inflammation.\n\nHot and cold compression therapy:\nHot and cold compression therapy involves alternating between applying heat and cold packs to the affected area. This can help reduce swelling, relieve pain, and promote blood flow. Hot compresses (usually warm water or a warm compress) can help increase blood flow and reduce inflammation, while cold compresses (usually ice or a cold pack) can help reduce pain and inflammation.\n\n",

Hormonal adjustment: After having the Implanon removed, your body may be taking some time to adjust to its natural hormonal balance. This can cause irregular bleeding or spotting, which may be what you're experiencing.\n2. Progesterone withdrawal: Implanon works by releasing a steady dose of progesterone into your body. When it's removed, your body may experience a withdrawal effect, which can cause bleeding or spotting.\n3. Cervical mucus: The thin, light discharge you're experiencing may be related to the natural cervical mucus production in your body. This is a normal part of the reproductive process, and it's not necessarily related to pregnancy.\n\nGiven that you've taken a pregnancy test and it was negative, it's unlikely that you're pregnant at this point.

However, please consult a doctor for personalized advice.\n\nIt seems like you're experiencing PCOD (Polycystic Ovary Disease) and irregular periods, which can make it challenging to conceive. Your doctor has recommended a three-month course of medication (Duloxetine-L and Ebexid) to help regulate your periods and ovulation. This is a common approach to treat PCOD.\n\nAnother doctor has suggested an ovulation induction drug, such as Clomiphene, to stimulate ovulation. Clomiphene is a medication that can help induce ovulation in women with PCOD. However, it's essential to discuss the risks and benefits of this medication with your doctor.\n\nHere are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Safety:** Both medications can have side effects, and it's crucial to discuss these with your doctor. Duloxetine-L and Ebexid may have different side effect profiles compared to Clomiphene.\n2. **Effectiveness:** While Clomiphene can induce ovulation, it may not necessarily solve your PCOD-related issues.

Since you're experiencing swelling after daily activities and still having pain, it's possible that the toe is taking longer to heal than expected.\n\nThere are a few reasons why your toe might be taking longer to heal:\n\n1. Trauma: The force of the stubbing can cause micro-tears in the soft tissues around the toe, leading to delayed healing.\n2. Nerve damage: The stubbing may have caused nerve damage, which can lead to persistent pain and numbness.\n3. Infection: Although you've iced the toe, there's still a small risk of infection, especially if the wound is not properly cleaned and dressed.\n\nAs for your knee pain, it's possible that it's unrelated to the stubbed toe.

Practice good posture when sitting or standing to reduce pressure on the affected area.\n2. Take regular breaks when typing to stretch and move around.\n3.

Wood glue is not suitable for human skin and can cause further irritation, infection, or even allergic reactions.\n\nInstead, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Clean the wound: Before changing the band-aid, gently clean the wound with mild soap and lukewarm water. Pat it dry with a clean towel.\n2. Apply antibiotic ointment: Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment to the wound to help prevent infection.\n3. Use a topical hemostatic agent: You can try using a topical hemostatic agent like Petrolatum or a commercial product like Gauze with Hemostatic Agent. These products help to stop bleeding and promote clotting.\n4. Use a pressure dressing: Apply a pressure dressing or a gauze pad soaked",

I'm happy to help you with your concerns.\n\nFirstly, it's not uncommon for people to experience some residual symptoms after gallbladder removal, especially in the first few months. However, the symptoms you're describing, including cramping under your rib cage and back, are unusual and may be worth further evaluation.\n\nSince your gallbladder has been removed, it's unlikely that you'll develop gallstones in the same way. Gallstones typically form in the gallbladder due to the concentration of bile and the presence of cholesterol or bilirubin. Without a gallbladder, bile flows directly into the small intestine, reducing the risk of stone formation.\n\nHowever, it's possible that you may be experiencing symptoms related to other conditions or factors. Here are a few potential explanations:\n\n1. Bile duct issues: Although your gallbladder is gone, your bile ducts may still be functioning. If there's a blockage or narrowing in the bile ducts, it could cause symptoms similar to those you experienced before the removal.\n2. Pancreatic or small intestine issues: Abdominal cramping and back pain can be caused by conditions affecting the pancreas or small intestine, such as pancreatitis, Crohn's disease, or",

It sounds like you've been experiencing chronic pain in your heel and neck areas.\n\nFirstly, let's discuss your plantar fascia pain. While a heel spur can certainly contribute to plantar fascia pain, it's not the only possible cause. Plantar fascia pain can also be caused by inflammation, strain, or irritation of the plantar fascia ligament, which runs along the bottom of the foot. Other factors that can contribute to plantar fascia pain include overuse, poor foot mechanics, and biomechanical issues.\n\nGiven that your pain is worse in your right foot, it's possible that there may be an underlying issue with the biomechanics of your right foot or ankle that's contributing to the pain. For example, if you have a tendency to overpronate or supinate, this could be putting additional stress on the plantar fascia and leading to pain.\n\nRegarding your neck pain, it's interesting that you've had persistent pain in the left side of your neck for over a year, despite normal X-rays. This could be indicative of a musculoskeletal issue, such as tension or strain in the neck muscles, or even a referred pain pattern from another area of the body",

However, I'm concerned about the potential effects of a very low-fat diet on your overall health.\n\nThe upper arm and leg pain you're experiencing, especially at night, could be related to several factors:\n\n1. **Gallstone symptoms:** Although you've lost weight, your gallstones might still be causing issues. The pain could be radiating from your gallbladder area to your upper arms and legs. However, this is unlikely to cause pain specifically at night.\n2. **Musculoskeletal issues:** The pain could be related to muscle strain or inflammation in your arms and legs, possibly due to your job requirements, such as lifting. This might be exacerbated by the weight loss and dietary changes.\n3. **Nutrient deficiencies:** A very low-fat diet can lead to deficiencies in essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. This could contribute to muscle pain, weakness, and stiffness.\n4. **Electrolyte imbalances:** A low-fat diet can disrupt electrolyte balances, particularly potassium, magnesium, and calcium. This could cause muscle cramps, weakness, and pain",

This occurs due to excessive oil secretion by the oil glands on the face. One of the causes for this is excessive washing of the face. When you wash your face too many times, it strips the natural oil from the face and paradoxically increases the activity of the oil glands to compensate for the loss of natural oils. Wash your face with a cleanser containing 2% salicylic acid twice a day. Do not use thick creams. Avoid oiling your hair. Avoid fried foods and foods with high glycemic index. Hope this helps you.

Hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy and the postpartum period can lead to changes in skin texture and oil production. Here are some possible causes of your oily skin:\n\n1. **Hormonal imbalance**: After pregnancy, your hormone levels may take time to stabilize, leading to an increase in sebum production, which can cause oily skin.\n2. **Changes in skin barrier function**: Pregnancy and childbirth can affect the skin's natural barrier function, leading to increased water loss and oil production.\n3. **Stress**: Caring for a newborn can be stressful, and stress can trigger hormonal imbalances, which can contribute to oily skin.\n4. **Dietary changes**: Breastfeeding can lead to changes in your diet, which may affect your skin.\n\nFor a permanent solution, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Maintain a consistent skincare routine**: Wash your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser, and use a toner to balance your skin's pH. Apply a lightweight moisturizer to help control oil production.\n2. **Use oil-controlling products**: Look for products labeled \"oil-free\"",

However, I do have some concerns regarding the long-term effects of consuming only blended foods.\n\nWhile it's true that blending your food can help with digestion and reduce the discomfort associated with eating solid foods, it's essential to consider the potential consequences of not chewing your food properly. Here are a few points to ponder:\n\n1. Nutrient absorption: When you don't chew your food well, it can lead to poor nutrient absorption. Chewing breaks down food into smaller particles, making it easier for your body to absorb the necessary nutrients. Blended foods may not be broken down as effectively, which could lead to nutrient deficiencies over time.\n2. Gut health: A diet consisting solely of blended foods may disrupt the balance of gut bacteria. A healthy gut microbiome is crucial for overall health, and a diet that's too smooth or lacks fiber can affect the diversity of gut bacteria.\n3. Dental health: Although you mentioned you don't have sore gums, it's essential to monitor your dental health closely. Consuming only blended foods can lead to issues like tooth decay, gum recession, or other",

In Mederma Stretch Mark Therapy, HA is likely used to help improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of stretch marks.\n\nRegarding the potential effects of HA on the baby, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that it poses a significant risk to the fetus. HA is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy, as it is a naturally occurring substance and is not absorbed systemically.\n\nHowever, as a precautionary measure, it's essential to note that HA can potentially stimulate the growth of new skin cells, which may theoretically increase the risk of skin irritation or allergic reactions in the baby. Although this risk is considered low, it's still important to monitor your baby's skin for any signs of irritation or sensitivity.\n\nTo ensure the safety of your baby, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Consult with your healthcare provider: Discuss your concerns and the use of Mederma Stretch Mark Therapy with your healthcare provider. They can assess the potential risks and benefits and provide personalized guidance.\n2.

Let's dive into the science behind using egg whites to help heal burns.\n\nThe idea of using egg whites to treat burns dates back to the 19th century, when it was first described by a French physician. The concept is that the protein-rich egg whites can help promote wound healing by:\n\n1. Reducing inflammation: Egg whites contain anti-inflammatory compounds like ovotransferrin, which may help reduce swelling and pain.\n2. Promoting tissue repair: The protein content in egg whites can provide essential building blocks for tissue repair and regeneration.\n3. Protecting the wound: Egg whites have been shown to have antimicrobial properties, which can help prevent infection and promote a clean wound environment.\n\nSeveral studies have investigated the use of egg whites in burn wound care. A 2011 study published in the Journal of Burn Care & Research found that applying egg whites to burn wounds in rats accelerated wound closure and improved tissue repair. Another study published in the Journal of Wound Care in 2017 found that egg whites reduced bacterial growth and promoted wound healing in human burn wounds.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that these studies were conducted in controlled laboratory settings, and more research is needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of using egg whites in",

It's great that you're using regular sunscreen to maintain your skin's protection.\n\nNow, let's address your concerns:\n\n1. Skin darkening when stopping Cosmelite: This is likely due to the temporary suppression of melanin production caused by the medication. When you stop using Cosmelite, your skin's natural melanin production may resume, leading to a temporary darkening of your skin tone. This is a common phenomenon and should resolve on its own once your skin adjusts.\n2. Skin darkening in winters: This could be due to several factors, including:\n\t* Reduced sun exposure during winter months, which may lead to a decrease in melanin production.\n\t* Dry air and cold temperatures, which can cause skin to appear dull and darker.\n\t* Increased use of indoor lighting, which can lead to skin appearing darker due to the blue light emitted.\n\nTo address your concerns, I recommend the following:\n\n* Continue using regular sunscreen with at least SPF 30 to protect your skin from UV damage.\n* Consider using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with antioxidants and moisturizing properties to help maintain your skin",

A liver biopsy involves inserting a needle through the skin and into the liver to collect a sample of liver tissue. This sample can then be examined under a microscope to look for any abnormalities.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting that you mention that the bumps or growths are not the normal looking cancer or non-cancer bumps, and that you don't have a Portal vein attached to your liver. This could suggest that the growths may be a result of a unique condition or anomaly. Without a Portal vein, your liver may be functioning differently, which could also affect the growths.\r\n\r\nIt's important to consult with a doctor or a medical professional to discuss your concerns and determine the best course of action.

Since you mentioned that the pulsation is stronger when you're lying on your stomach, it's possible that you're feeling the pulse of the aorta itself.

The inferior mesenteric artery: This artery is a branch of the aorta that supplies blood to the intestines. It's located near the umbilicus and can cause a palpable pulsation.\n2.

Scrub typhus is a tick-borne disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, which is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including Myanmar.

The risk of incompatibility is generally higher when the father's blood group is A or B, and the mother's blood group is A or B.\n\n**Thalassemia:**\nThalassemia is an inherited disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin.

This is more common in cases of pneumonia or bronchitis. Since you've had a productive cough and head cold for three weeks, it's possible that the infection has spread to the muscles in your back, causing pain.\n2. **Muscle strain**: It's also possible that you may have strained a muscle in your back, which could be related to your coughing and sneezing.

This is an estimate of the length of pregnancy, and it's used to determine the expected due date and the timing of various prenatal tests and procedures.\n\nThe reason why gestational age is calculated from the start of the LMP, rather than the date of conception, is because it's difficult to determine the exact date of conception. However, the LMP is a reliable indicator of when ovulation is likely to have occurred, and ovulation typically occurs around 14 days before the start of a period.\n\nSo, when you calculate your gestational age, you're actually counting forward from the start of your LMP, not the date of conception. This means that the gestational age is likely to be around 2-3 weeks ahead of the actual age of the embryo.\n\nIn your case, if your LMP was October 25, 2010, and you're now 10 weeks and 6 days pregnant, it's likely that you conceived around November 1-2, 2010.

Let's break down what you've described:\n\n* The pain started about 3 months ago in the dimple of your back, which is a common area for back pain to occur.\n* The pain worsens when you move your back quickly or move your leg, which suggests that it might be related to muscle or joint inflammation.\n* You've described periods where the pain becomes severe and you're unable to move at all, which is concerning. However, it's reassuring that the pain tends to resolve on its own the next morning.\n* The pain returns about a month later, which could indicate a recurring pattern.\n\nBased on your symptoms, I'd like to consider a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Musculoskeletal strain**: It's possible that you've developed a strain in your back muscles, which could be causing the pain. This might be due to overuse, poor posture, or other factors.\n2. **Joint inflammation**: The pain in your back and leg could be related to inflammation in your joints, particularly in the lumbar spine or sacroiliac joint.\n3. **Referred pain",

They will assess your condition, medical history, and other factors to determine the best course of action.\n\nRegarding the surgery for kidney stone removal, there are a few options to consider:\n\n1. Shock Wave Lithotripsy (SWL): This is a non-invasive procedure that uses shock waves to break down the stone into smaller pieces that can then be passed out of the body through urine. The success rate of SWL depends on the size and location of the stone, as well as the patient's overall health.\n2. Ureteroscopic Lithotripsy (URSL): This is a minimally invasive procedure that uses a ureteroscope (a thin, flexible tube with a camera and light on the end) to locate the stone and break it down using laser or electrohydraulic energy.\n3. Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL): This is a more invasive procedure that involves making a small incision in the back to access the kidney and remove the stone.

To feel the heartbeat, you would typically place your hand on the front of the chest, specifically on the left side, just below the nipple line.

The heart is approximately the size of a fist, but it's not a perfect sphere. It's more like a flattened, ellipsoidal shape. This is because the heart has to accommodate the aortic valve and the pulmonary valve, which are located on the right and left sides, respectively.\n\n3. The heart beats approximately 100,000 times per day, which translates to around 3 billion beats per year. For a 22-year-old, that's approximately 1.3 trillion beats in their lifetime.\n\n4. The heart squeezes blood into the chambers with a force equivalent to about 1-2 atmospheres (1013 mbar).

A lot of people have it genetically predetermined, although parents may/may not have it. A frequent cause of non-genetic lip darkening is the use of lipsticks /colored balms/gloss, as these tend to darken the lips over a period of time. So try and not use it too often. If you have to use it, then let it be alleged free and replace them every 2 months. I would advise you to start using medicated lip balms with SPF and to reapply it several times in a day.that helps in reducing further darkening. Definite cream or any others having Comic acid can be used twice a day for lightening of lip color. It usually does not have side effects. However u can check for tolerance of the product by applying it for a short time on the first application. If you have a genetic tendency to dark lips, the pigmentation has chances of coming back after the cream is stopped. U can also opt for mild chemical peels once in 15-30 days to exfoliate better and lighten faster. Take care!",

        "generated": "\n\nGood morning! Congratulations on the arrival of your twins!\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're seeking medical advice. Disentery, also known as diarrhea, is a common issue in infants, especially in the first few weeks of life. Given that your twins are only a few weeks old, it's essential to address this issue promptly to prevent dehydration and other complications.\n\nSince your pediatrician has already recommended Nestle Nan Pro 1, it's essential to continue with this formula for now. However, to manage the diarrhea, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Increase the frequency of feeding**: Feed your twins more frequently, but in smaller amounts. This will help to replace the lost fluids and electrolytes. You can try feeding them every 2-3 hours, or as directed by your pediatrician.\n2. **Monitor their stool output**: Keep an eye on the frequency and consistency of their stools. If the diarrhea persists or worsens, it's crucial to consult with your pediatrician again.\n3. **Provide plenty of fluids**: In addition to the formula, you can offer breast milk or an oral rehydration solution like Pedialyte to help replace lost fluids and electrolytes. However, consult with your pediatrician before giving any oral rehydration solution",

It does have an effect on your chances of getting pregnant in the future.

Even though it needs clinical assessment for a diagnosis, from your history, it seems that you have inflammation/calculi in your gall bladder/biliary system giving rise to such intermittent severe pain. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to avoid fatty/oily food which would precipitate the pain more due to contraction of the gall bladder to empty bile into the intestines.  I would advise you a bland diet, some routine investigations like a CBC, a blood sugar, liver function test, a serum amylase and lipase to rule out associated pancreatitis, and an ultrasound abdomen to see the status of the biliary tree including the gall bladder to exclude a stone causing cholecystitis and also to know the status of the pancreas. Further management would depend on the result of clinical examination and reports of the related investigations. Till then, you could go for an anti-spasmodic along with a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

        "generated": "\n\nI'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this distressing experience, Anne. I'm here to help you navigate your options.\n\nFirstly, let's address your concerns about antibiotics. You're correct that antibiotics may not penetrate inside the abscess effectively, and it's also important to consider your severe allergic reactions to them. In this case, it's best to avoid antibiotics unless absolutely necessary.\n\nGiven your symptoms, I suspect that the abscess may be a sign of a dental infection. Since you're allergic to most antibiotics, we may need to explore alternative treatments.\n\nConsidering your creatinine level of 85 and blood pressure of 100/60, you don't seem to have any significant kidney or cardiovascular concerns that would affect your treatment options.\n\nHere are a few potential next steps:\n\n1. **Dental evaluation**: I strongly recommend scheduling an appointment with an oral surgeon or a dentist who specializes in abscesses and dental infections. They will assess the abscess, take a thorough medical history, and may perform a drainage procedure to relieve the abscess. This may help reduce the pain and swelling.\n2. **Incision and drainage**: The dentist or oral surgeon may perform an incision and drainage procedure to drain the abscess. This can be done",

Please consult qualified Urologist for clinical and digital rectal examination and get following basic tests done to confirm the diagnosis.1) Urine routine and culture.2) Ultrasound scanning of abdomen and pelvis3) Semen examination and semen culture.In the meanwhile start taking antibiotics like Doxycycline along with anti-inflammatory medicine Diclofenac twice daily. Further treatment will depend upon result of these tests and final diagnosis. Please note that Prostatitis takes long time to get cured hence one has to take appropriate antibiotics for a period of 6-8 weeks. Chat Doctor.",

However, the persistence of symptoms over the years, despite antibiotic treatment, warrants further evaluation.\n\nThe symptoms you've described, such as:\n\n1. Feeling of testes being a little tight\n2. Slower urination\n3. Yellowish or pale semen color\n4. Slight heavy feeling in testes while sitting\n\nmay be related to various factors, including:\n\n* Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland)\n* Epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis, the tube that stores sperm)\n* Prostate hyperplasia (enlargement of the prostate gland)\n* Testicular torsion or varicocele (abnormal blood flow in the scrotum)\n\nThe painful ejaculation you experienced during your wet dream and oral sex may be related to:\n\n* Prostatitis or epididymitis\n* Testicular torsion or varicocele\n* Scrotal trauma or injury\n\nI recommend that you consult",

It is not seen in all women but can be seen with some around the time of periods. In this condition avoiding spicy food and taking an antacid before meals during and around periods can help. Warm saline gargles can be relieving. Swelling of gums around the wisdom tooth occurs as a result of inflammation and is known as PERITONITIS, and it can occur as a result of infection by food deposition between the gum flap and the wisdom tooth or if the flap is bitten by the opposite jaw tooth. It can lead to pain radiating to jaw, throat, ear,eye and head. In this condition consultation with a dentist and getting an x-ray done is needed. In case tooth is not impacted and will erupt normally removal of the gum flap by a minor surgical procedure can help. In case of impacted tooth extraction can provide permanent relief.

On the other hand, if it's a bacterial infection, antibiotics like cotrimoxazole might be necessary.\n\nRegarding compatibility with ambroxol, cotrimoxazole is generally considered safe to use with mucolytic agents like ambroxol.

It is often diagnosed in adolescence and early adulthood.\n\nWhile a lumbar puncture (also known as a spinal tap) can cause temporary back pain and discomfort, it is not a known risk factor for developing idiopathic scoliosis. The procedure is generally safe and well-tolerated, and the risk of complications is low.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the patient's underlying condition, meningococcal septocemia, may have contributed to the development of scoliosis. Meningococcal septocemia is a serious infection that can cause inflammation and damage to the spine, which may lead to scoliosis or other spinal deformities.\n\nIt's also important to note that scoliosis can develop in people of any age, and it's not uncommon for people to develop scoliosis in their early 20s.

Actually radiation reaches fetus in comparatively less dose, as it goes through mothers body to reach it.  - Radiation exposure in first 2 weeks of conception may cause fetal death.  - exposure to large dose radiation( Like dose received from 500 chest X-rays) in early weeks of conception (2 to 18 weeks of pregnancy) is hazardous to fetus- it causes developmental defects in fetus-specially brain developments.- leading to low IQ s & mental retardation or stunted growth./ likelihood to develop cancer in later life.  _ Same type of consequences are observed in fetuses between 18 and 26 weeks when exposed to double the dose of radiation.  -After 26 weeks baby is fully grown & there is no possibility of developmental defects after radiation exposure except for slightly more chances of having cancer in later life.  * Though no bad effects of radiation exposure of mother before conception are reflected on fetuses, the conception should be postponed, specially when it is a planned conception.

        "generated": "\n\nCongratulations on receiving good news from your follow-up mammogram and ultrasound!\n\nRegarding your question, it's great that you're thinking ahead and considering the potential risks to your future pregnancy. The mammogram you had today used a low-dose radiation exposure, which is typically considered safe for women who are not pregnant.\n\nHowever, it's still important to consider the potential risks of radiation exposure during pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women who have had radiation therapy or have been exposed to high levels of radiation (more than 5 rads) avoid becoming pregnant for at least 6-12 months after exposure. Low-dose radiation exposure, like the type used in mammography, is generally considered safe and is not typically associated with an increased risk of birth defects or miscarriage.\n\nThat being said, it's always better to err on the side of caution. If you're planning to become pregnant, it's recommended to wait at least 3-6 months after your mammogram before trying to conceive. This allows for any potential effects of the radiation to dissipate.\n\nIt's also important to note that your biopsy 6 months ago likely involved a much higher dose of radiation than your mammogram today.

Moreover, since you have conceived once, so it is appropriate for you to wait for at least three months before undergoing any infertility investigations and management. Chances to conceive in each menstrual cycle is only 20-25 %, therefore do not take stress and try for natural conception for at least next3-4 months. Hope you found the answer helpful. Wishing you good health. Chat Doctor.",
        "generated": "\n\nI'm happy to help you with your concerns. Since you've had an abortion in January this year, it's essential to ensure your body has fully recovered and your reproductive health is stable before trying to conceive again.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're getting regular periods, which suggests that your uterus is shedding its lining and preparing for a potential pregnancy. However, the presence of dark brown blood clots in your period last month might be a cause for concern.\n\nDark brown blood clots can indicate several things:\n\n1. Hormonal imbalance: It's possible that your hormone levels are not yet balanced, which might be affecting your ability to conceive.\n2. Uterine lining issues: The uterine lining might not be thick enough or healthy enough to support a pregnancy.\n3. Infection or inflammation: There's a small chance that you might have an underlying infection or inflammation in your uterus, which could be affecting your fertility.\n\nGiven your history of unprotected sex over the past three months without conceiving, it's possible that there might be other factors at play. I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Wait for the recommended three months as advised by your gynecologist. This will allow your body to fully recover from the abortion and your hormone levels to stabilize",

However, without further information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.\n\nThe negative viral markers, including hepatitis B and C, are reassuring, as they suggest that his liver damage is unlikely to be caused by viral hepatitis.\n\nThe normal blood pressure and lack of diabetes mellitus (DM) are also positive findings.\n\nThe elevated T.

When we're under stress or feeling anxious, our body's \"fight or flight\" response is triggered, which can cause us to breathe more rapidly and shallowly. This can lead to hyperventilation and the symptoms you're experiencing.\n\nThere are a few things you can try to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Deep breathing exercises: Practice slow, deep breathing exercises to help calm your nervous system and reduce your heart rate.\n2. Progressive muscle relaxation: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body to help reduce muscle tension and promote relaxation.\n3.

If he was diagnosed at an age 18,was he on antihypertensives?. If not then he should be immediately be on one. Left uncontrolled, he may wind up with a disability, a poor quality of life or even a fatal heart attack. High blood pressure might cause damage to his heart(Coronary artery disease, Enlarged left heart, heart failure), brain(Transient ischemic attack, mild cognitive impairment, stroke), kidney(failure) and a lot more if not treated. So I would suggest you to force him to see a doctor. Nothing is worth a life. In the meantime, he should follow strict diet plan like;1)Low salt and low fat diet2)eat fruits and vegetables which are rich in potassium and magnesium3)Exercise at least 30-40minutes a day to lose those extra body fat.

It's not uncommon for people with uncontrolled hypertension to experience symptoms like dizziness, headache, and even loss of consciousness.\n\nGiven your son's history of hypertension and his recent episode of loss of consciousness, it's crucial that he seeks medical attention as soon as possible. Refusing medical care can put him at risk of further complications, including stroke, heart attack, and kidney damage.\n\nI understand your son's concerns about insurance, but there may be options available to him. Many hospitals offer emergency services regardless of insurance status, and some clinics offer sliding-scale fees or community clinics that provide affordable care.\n\nAs for forcing him to go to the doctor, it's essential to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. It's possible that your son is feeling overwhelmed and stressed about his job situation, and that's contributing to his reluctance to seek medical care.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n1. Have a calm and empathetic conversation with your son about the importance of seeking medical attention. Emphasize that you're concerned about his health and well-being, and that you",

While running the heart rate detector may mistake your body vibrations and movements for heart beats and count them accordingly. Hence the heart rate may erroneously show a high reading. So you have to check whether it happens to you only or with everyone. Another thing that can be done is a treadmill test. It requires you to run on a treadmill, the speed of which increases gradually to a point till your heart rate reaches a target rate. This TMT test will continuously record your EKG while you are running so all aberrations and errors can be rules out. It will definitely show whether you really have a fast heart rate on exercising. If it documents very fast heart rate further work up can be done. Wishing you good health. Thank you",

If not, it's likely that your heart is functioning normally.\n\nGiven your healthy status and the absence of any concerning symptoms, it's unlikely that you have a significant underlying cardiac issue.

As you've grown older, it's not uncommon for asthma symptoms to fluctuate, and it's possible that environmental or lifestyle factors may be contributing to your recent symptoms.\n\nAsthma is a chronic condition, and there is no cure. However, with proper management, you can control your symptoms and lead a normal life.\n\nSince you're experiencing frequent asthma attacks, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. **Consult your doctor**: It's essential to consult your doctor to rule out any underlying conditions that may be triggering your symptoms. Your doctor may perform some tests, such as spirometry, to assess your lung function and determine the best course of treatment.\n2. **Adjust your medication**: Your doctor may adjust your medication regimen to better control your symptoms. This could include increasing the dose of your inhaler medication, adding a new medication, or switching to a different type of inhaler.\n3. **Identify and avoid triggers**: Try to identify what's triggering your asthma attacks. Common triggers include:\n\t* Allergies (dust mites, mold, pet dander, etc.)\n\t* Respiratory infections (cold",

The center of the bump can become white due to the accumulation of mucus. These cysts are usually painless but can become painful if they become infected or inflamed.\n3. **Oral papilloma**: This is a benign growth that can occur on the mucous membranes inside the mouth.

        "generated": "\n\nI understand your concern, and it's natural to worry about any unusual changes in your body. Based on your description, it's unlikely that the red pimple-like dot is related to cancer. Here's why:\n\n1. Location: The location of the lesion on the inside of your cheek is not a common site for oral cancer.\n2. Appearance: A red, small, and non-ulcerated lesion is not typical of oral cancer. Oral cancer lesions are often white, red, or a combination of both, and can be irregularly shaped.\n3. Size: The size of the lesion is also not consistent with oral cancer. Most oral cancer lesions are larger than a small pimple.\n4. Duration: The fact that the lesion has been present for a few weeks and is not healing is more likely related to a chronic inflammatory response or a minor trauma from the implant surgery, rather than cancer.\n\nIt's possible that the lesion is a foreign body granuloma, which is a small, inflammatory reaction to a foreign object, such as a piece of food or a small implant material, that has become lodged in the tissue. This type of reaction is common after oral surgery and can cause a small, red, and non-healing lesion.\n\nIt's great that",

        "generated": "\n\nI'd be happy to help you try to determine what the bump on the back of your leg might be. Based on your description, it's possible that the bump could be related to ringworm, but it's also possible that it could be a bug bite or something else entirely.\n\nTo help narrow down the possibilities, can you tell me a bit more about the bump? For example:\n\n* What does the bump look like? Is it a red, itchy, circular patch, or is it a small, raised bump?\n* How big is the bump? Is it small, or is it quite large?\n* Where exactly is the bump located on the back of your leg? Is it on the inner thigh, outer thigh, or somewhere in between?\n* Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as itching, burning, or redness around the bump?\n* Have you been in any areas where you might have been exposed to insects, such as ticks or mosquitoes, recently?\n\nIt's also important to note that ringworm is a fungal infection that can be spread through skin-to-skin contact, so it's possible that you could have gotten it from your boyfriend. However, it's also important to consider other possibilities, such as a bug bite or an allergic reaction",

Nevertheless, it's essential to identify the underlying cause to prevent complications.\n\nGiven your symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, and worsening panic attacks, it's possible that your low platelet count is related to an underlying condition. Here are a few potential causes to consider:\n\n1. **Viral infections**: Viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, or HIV, can cause a low platelet count.\n2. **Autoimmune disorders**: Conditions like idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis can lead to a low platelet count.\n3. **Cancer**: In some cases, a low platelet count can be a sign of an underlying cancer,",

Usually blood pressure less than 90/6)MMH is considered as significant hypotension /low blood pressure. So, yes you have problem of hypertension sometimes. So my advice to you is - ask your doctor about 24 hrs ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. This test will measure your blood pressure automatically at home. The results of this will guide your doctor about readjustment of your BP medication. Meanwhile, if you have any further episode of low blood pressure, you can reduce the dosage to half at that point of time. So, my advice to you is gone for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring recording and readjust your blood pressure medications dosage and frequency. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

However, readings as low as 88/58 mmHg are concerning, especially considering you're taking medication for hypertension.\n\nThere are a few potential explanations for your low blood pressure:\n\n1. **Medication side effects**: Your blood pressure medication, though effective in controlling hypertension, could be causing a drop in blood pressure, especially if you're taking it with other medications or supplements that can interact with it.\n2. **Dehydration**: As a menopausal woman, you might be more prone to dehydration due to changes in hormone levels and increased risk of urinary incontinence. Dehydration can cause blood pressure to drop.\n3. **Anxiety and stress**: Your anxiety and menopause-related symptoms might be causing your blood pressure to fluctuate, potentially leading to low readings.\n4. **Other medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as autonomic nervous system dysfunction, hypothyroidism, or anemia, can cause low blood pressure.\n\nGiven your symptoms and blood pressure readings, I would recommend the following:\n\n",

Cause of the health problems you queried-There are many causes of the lumps on your right knee after the recent fall. To rule out other causes, I would advise you to consult ER surgeon, who would examine it and treat it accordingly. Still with my expertise and experience, I would suggest you to rule out following causes with your ER OrthoSurgeon. Cause in your case-As the lump is of 2 1/2 weeks duration after review of your query data, it seems to be due to either of the following reasons--Post-traumatic Hematoma with traumatic swelling-which is in process of recovery and may take another 2-3 weeks.-If it doesn't settle after 4-6 weeks, Pre-Patellar Bursitis(Housemaids Knee)-post-traumatic needs to be ruled out. Both above possibilities needs to be ruled as only discomfort is felt by you while walking. In the absence of more information, I would advise Second opinion in your case, who would examine it and investigate it to treat it as per the cause of the lump. So I would advise you to consult ER OrthoSurgeon, who would rule out other causes of such a lump and would help you out with the fist hand information. Do take his Second Opinion, on the above suggestion, as he would advise you with fist hand clinical information. Hope this would resolve your query with full satisfaction.

        "generated": "\n\nBased on your description, it's possible that the lump on your knee is a hematoma or a Baker's cyst.\n\nA hematoma is a collection of blood that has accumulated in the soft tissues of the knee, typically as a result of trauma, such as your fall. It can take several weeks for the blood to be reabsorbed, which is consistent with your 2.5-week timeline. The lump may be painful to the touch, especially if it's still filled with blood or if it's becoming infected.\n\nA Baker's cyst, on the other hand, is a type of fluid-filled sac that can develop in the back of the knee. It's often caused by inflammation or injury to the knee joint, and it can be painful, especially when pressed. Baker's cysts are more common in people with conditions like osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, but they can also occur in people without any underlying medical conditions.\n\nOther possible causes of the lump on your knee could include:\n\n* A ganglion cyst: A non-cancerous growth that can develop in the joints or tendons. Ganglion cysts are typically soft and movable, but they can be painful if they press on nearby nerves.\n* A lipoma: A benign tumor",

These symptoms are related to the job profile. As teachers have to stand longer, teachers have no proper physical health care, always tensions and troubles etc. The reason for the pain in knees are due to early OA changes in the knee joint, and the leg pain is added to the standing for the long run. Pain in the middle finger is the reason due to cervical spine disc nerve root entrapment due to postural changes. I will advise for doing regular exercise which includes the strengthening of the neck muscles, upper limb muscles, inter-scapular muscle, knee muscles, leg muscles, hip muscles, core muscles etc. As these muscles are used in a wrong posture and repetitive stress injury is occurred to the tissues, joints and ligaments.

Sometimes due to fall there are chances that you may damage the soft tissue of the lumbar spine and also the bony alignments are disturbed.

Cutting or attempting to remove the wart yourself can lead to further complications, such as infection, scarring, and potentially worsening the condition.\n\nInstead, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Consult a dermatologist: I would encourage you to schedule an appointment with a dermatologist who specializes in treating genital warts. They can examine the area, confirm the diagnosis, and provide you with the best course of treatment.\n2. Topical treatments: Your dermatologist may prescribe topical treatments, such as cantharidin or salicylic acid, which can help dissolve",

The Emeset (ondansetron) and Nexpro Junior sachet (esomeprazole) prescribed by his doctor are likely aimed at managing nausea and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), respectively.\n\nSince your son has had some improvement with rice, but still vomits with oats, it's possible that he might have some food intolerance or sensitivity. The fact that he's been eating but vomiting after some time suggests that he might be experiencing delayed gastric emptying, which could be contributing to the vomiting.\n\nGiven that he's still vomiting despite the initial two-day course of Emeset and Nexpro Junior, I would recommend continuing these medications for a few more days to ensure that his symptoms are fully managed. It's also important to note that the Emeset is an anti-emetic medication, and it may take some time to fully resolve the vomiting.\n\nHowever, since he's still experiencing vomiting",

The tender pads of your fingertips, especially the index fingers, are a common complaint, but it's not typically caused by typing alone. The fact that it's affecting more fingers now suggests that there might be an underlying cause. I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you explore some possible explanations.\n\nHere are a few potential causes to consider:\n\n1. **Raynaud's phenomenon**: This is a condition where the blood vessels in your fingers and toes constrict in response to cold temperatures or stress, causing discoloration and sensitivity. If you experience this, you might notice your fingers turning white or blue when exposed to cold.\n2. **Osteoarthritis**: As we age, the cartilage in our joints can wear down, leading to inflammation and pain. The joints in your fingers might be affected, causing tenderness and sensitivity.\n3. **Repetitive strain injury**: While typing can cause strain on your fingers, it's unlikely to cause persistent tenderness and sensitivity. However, if you've recently changed your typing habits or have been using a new keyboard, it's possible that you've developed a repetitive strain injury.\n4. **Nutritional deficiencies**: Deficiencies in vitamins like B",

While it's true that the lumps could be benign, such as hard breast tissue or a cystic fibroid, it's also possible that they could be indicative of a more serious condition, such as breast cancer.\n\nIn general, the American Cancer Society recommends that women with a family history of breast cancer or other risk factors have a mammogram every year starting at age 40. However, for a 29-year-old woman with no known risk factors, the American College of Radiology recommends that she have a screening mammogram every 2-3 years.\n\nIn this case, the doctor's advice to follow up in 6 months or sooner if there are any changes or pain may be reasonable, but it's also important to note that breast cancer can be aggressive and may not always present with symptoms.

In your case, the lack of a visible bruise mark is not uncommon, especially if the contusion is superficial or if the bleeding has resolved quickly.

The contusion may have occurred in a location where bruising is less likely to occur, such as the deeper tissues of the lower back.\n\nRegarding the pain, it's not uncommon for people to experience sharp pain when sitting or standing up after a contusion. This can be due to the inflammation and swelling in the affected area, which can irritate the surrounding tissues and cause pain.\n\nAs for the duration of pain, it's difficult to predict exactly when it will resolve completely.

When the foreskin is stuck to the glans, it's known as adhesion or phimosis. This can be caused by various factors, such as inadequate foreskin care, tightness of the foreskin, or even inflammation.\n\nIn your case, it seems that retracting the foreskin daily for cleaning is causing the adhesion to worsen, leading to tearing and bleeding. This is likely due to the repeated trauma and irritation caused by forcing the foreskin to retract when it's not meant to.\n\nHere are some recommendations to help you manage your foreskin care:\n\n1. **Avoid daily retraction**: As you've experienced, daily retraction can cause more harm than good. Instead, try to limit retraction to once a week, as you're currently doing.\n2. **Use a gentle soap**: When cleaning the penis, use a mild, fragrance-free soap that's designed for sensitive skin.

Since the discharge is painless, not accompanied by pain during urination or erection problems, and is relatively rare (occurring every three days), it's unlikely to be related to a urinary tract infection (UTI) or inflammation.\n\nThe fact that the discharge is relegated to the head of the penis, around the opening, suggests that it might be related to the urethra or the meatus (the opening of the urethra). Here are a few possibilities to consider:\n\n1. **Urethral granulation tissue**: After urethoplasty, granulation tissue can form in the urethra, which can lead to a discharge. Although you mentioned no problems since the surgery, it's possible that this tissue has been present for years and is now manifesting as a discharge.\n2. **Bladder diverticulum-related issue**: The diverticulum itself could be causing a localized irritation or inflammation, leading to the discharge",

Based on your description, it's possible that the lump you're feeling is a rib cartilage prominence or a costal cartilage prominence.\n\nCostal cartilages are the cartilages that connect the ribs to the sternum (breastbone). They can sometimes become prominent or bulge out, especially when you're breathing in or out, or when you're in certain positions. This can cause a lump or a bump to feel like it's protruding from the chest wall.\n\nIn your case, the fact that the lump is located at the junction of the last ribs and the sternum, and that it's more noticeable when you're breathing out and pulling your tummy in, suggests that it might be a costal cartilage prominence.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to have a healthcare professional examine you to confirm the diagnosis. Your doctor may perform a physical examination, take a medical history, and possibly order imaging tests such as a chest X-ray or a CT scan to rule out any other possible causes of the lump.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to alleviate any discomfort or concern by practicing deep breathing exercises, which can help to reduce the prominence of the cartilage.

Given that you've had all the necessary tests and everything seems fine, let's discuss the role of Clomid and Progynova in increasing your chances of conception.\n\nClomid (50mg) is a common medication used to induce ovulation in women with ovulation disorders. It works by stimulating the pituitary gland to release more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which in turn causes the ovaries to release multiple eggs during ovulation. This increases the chances of fertilization and subsequent pregnancy.\n\nProgynova (2mg) is a progestin medication that helps to support the development of the uterine lining, making it more receptive to implantation of a fertilized egg.\n\nCombining Clomid and Progynova can increase your chances of conception in several ways:\n\n1. Induced ovulation: Clomid can help stimulate ovulation, releasing multiple eggs, which increases the chances of fertilization.\n2. Improved uterine receptivity: Progynova helps to thicken the uterine lining, making it more conducive to implantation of a fertilized egg.\n3.

A lump in the inguinal region can simply be due to inflammation of the lymph nodes over there due to some infection. Spotting is not due to these lumps. Do not neglect your diet. Have regular diets. You see anxiety is an ailment which can be overcome very easily. Try relaxation techniques like consciously breathing in and out twice a day for 5 minutes. It will help you to relax. Every night before going to sleep write out 3 things that went well that day, it can be anything like you read a good story book, or you helped someone in the street, cooked a delicious dish just anything. For the lump, I would suggest you to visit a doctor and get it examined. It may be nothing serious, just a routine checkup. Have a nice day. Regards",

Let's break down the possible causes and factors that might be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n1. Swollen lymph nodes:\nIt's possible that the swelling you noticed is due to enlarged lymph nodes in your inguinal area, which could be related to an infection or inflammation. However, without a medical examination, it's difficult to determine the exact cause.\n\n2. Spotting:\nSpotting can be caused by various factors, including hormonal changes, stress, and anxiety. As you mentioned, you're on birth control, which can cause irregular bleeding or spotting. Additionally, stress and anxiety can affect your menstrual cycle and lead to spotting.\n\n3. Diet and stress:\nYour diet and stress levels can indeed contribute to hormonal imbalances and affect your menstrual cycle. As a small, skinny girl, you might be more prone to hormonal fluctuations. Stress can also exacerbate hormonal imbalances and lead to spotting.\n\n4. Sexually active and birth control:\nAs you're sexually active and on birth control, there's a possibility that the swelling and spotting could be related to an STI or a hormonal imbalance caused by",

A nasal septal hematoma is a collection of blood that forms between the nasal septum (the thin wall of cartilage and bone that separates the two sides of the nasal passages) and the overlying skin.\n\nThe symptoms you're describing, such as a painful lump, redness, swelling, and throbbing pain, are consistent with this diagnosis. The hematoma can cause pressure on the surrounding tissues, leading to pain and discomfort. The fact that the pain worsens when you bend forward, causing blood to rush to your nose, is also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nNasal septal hematomas can occur due to various reasons such as trauma to the nose, nose picking, or even a nosebleed that has spread to the underlying tissues.\n\nAs for treatment, it's essential to seek medical attention as soon as possible to prevent further complications. Your healthcare provider may recommend the following:\n\n1. Draining the hematoma: This may involve inserting a needle or a small incision to release the blood and relieve pressure on the surrounding tissues.\n2.

This is a relatively common finding in infants and often resolves on its own as the heart grows and develops.\n* Mild LVE (good biventricular function): This means that the left ventricle (the main pumping chamber of the heart) is functioning well, and both ventricles (the left and right chambers) are pumping blood effectively. The term \"biventricular function\" refers to the coordinated pumping action of both ventricles.\n* Mild TR (Rusp24+Rap): This refers to a mild degree of tricuspid regurgitation, which means that the tricuspid valve (between the right atrium and ventricle) is also leaking slightly.

The bump you're describing, located on the right cheek of your buttocks, is likely a result of this condition.\n\nThe pain and discomfort you're experiencing are common symptoms of a coccygeal hematoma. The fact that Advil has been effective in managing your pain suggests that the condition is likely related to inflammation rather than infection.\n\nThe lack of redness and irritation around the bump is unusual, but it's possible that the hematoma has formed a \"capsule\" around itself, which can reduce the amount of swelling and redness. However, it's still important to seek medical attention as soon as possible to rule out any underlying infections or other complications.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some tips that may help you manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Continue taking Advil as directed to help manage your pain.\n2. Apply an ice pack to the affected area",

The symptoms you're describing, such as the dark bruise and swelling around the ankle bone, are concerning and require further evaluation.\n\nThere are several possibilities that could be contributing to the bruise and swelling:\n\n1. **Peroneal subluxation**: The peroneal tendons, which run along the outer ankle, can subluxate or dislocate due to the hypermobility associated with EDS. This can cause bruising, swelling, and pain.\n2. **Tarsal tunnel syndrome**: The tarsal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the ankle that contains the posterior tibial nerve. Compression or irritation of this nerve can cause numbness, tingling, and pain in the ankle and foot, which may lead to bruising and swelling.\n3. **Ankle instability**: Your EDS may be causing instability in the ankle joint, leading to repeated micro-trauma and bruising.\n4. **V",

The reason is not only could he get himself into trouble, but he also poses a serious threat to others around him.  Secondly, such recent changes in behavior or personality can often be a consequence of a brain pathology, and thus needs prompt evaluation. Disorders involving the frontal lobe of the brain, like frontal lobe dementia, vascular problems, etc. are typically known to cause such kind of disinhibited behavior. So, I would strongly advise you to take him to a psychiatrist, who would be able to assess him further and initiate appropriate management.

I'd be happy to help you with your concern.\n\nThe lump you're describing sounds like a common complication after a fracture, especially one that's taken a long time to heal. In your case, it's possible that the lump is a calcium deposit, also known as a heterotopic ossification (HO).\n\nHO is a condition where bone forms in soft tissues, such as muscles, tendons, or ligaments, outside of the normal bone structure. In your case, it's likely that the calcium deposit is a result of the body's natural healing process, where the bone has grown back into the surrounding soft tissues.\n\nWhile calcium deposits can be a normal part of the healing process, they can sometimes cause problems. If the deposit becomes large enough, it can put pressure on surrounding nerves, tendons, or ligaments, leading to pain, swelling, or limited mobility.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the calcium deposit, I would recommend consulting with an orthopedic specialist or a primary care physician. They may order imaging tests such as X-rays or an MRI to get a better view of the affected area.\n\nIn some cases, calcium deposits can be treated with physical therapy, bracing, or even surgery to remove",

This will help your doctor determine if the current treatment plan is working or if additional measures are needed.\n2. **Pain management**: In addition to elevating and icing, you can try some pain management techniques such as:\n\t* Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen (always follow the recommended dosage).\n\t* Stretching exercises to improve ankle mobility and reduce stiffness.\n\t* Strengthening exercises to improve ankle stability and reduce",

Hormonal imbalances, stress, and changes in lifestyle can all affect menstrual cycles and bleeding patterns.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the Implanon may have stopped working or is not functioning as effectively as it should.

Given your medical history, I'll do my best to help you address the issue of swollen ankles.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to consider the possibility that your swollen ankles might be related to your upcoming gallbladder surgery. Sometimes, changes in hormone levels or electrolyte imbalances can occur before surgery, which can lead to fluid retention and swelling. Additionally, the stress of surgery can also contribute to fluid retention.\n\nIn your case, the combination of your pre-existing conditions, such as osteoarthritis, asthma, and eczema, might also be contributing to your swollen ankles. For example, osteoarthritis can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints, which can spread to other areas of the body, including the ankles. Similarly, asthma can cause fluid retention due to hormonal imbalances.\n\nGiven that you're already taking water retention tablets, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. **Increase your fluid intake**: Drink plenty of water to help flush out excess fluids and reduce swelling. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water per day.\n2. **Elevate your legs**: Whenever you're sitting or lying down, elevate your legs above the level of your heart to reduce swelling and promote blood flow",

Cervical cancer typically appears as abnormal cell changes or lesions on the cervix, not as black spots resembling moles.\n\nHowever, it's possible that the black spots could be a benign condition, such as a cervical polyp or a benign growth.

There are several possible reasons why your scar may be bleeding, and I'll outline a few potential explanations:\n\n1. **Fibrosis and scarring**: The reconstruction surgery you underwent in 2000 may have led to excessive scarring and fibrosis (the growth of scar tissue) in the affected area. Over time, this scarring can cause the blood vessels in the surrounding tissue to become fragile and prone to bleeding.\n2. **Vascular malformation**: It's possible that the stab wound or subsequent surgery may have caused a vascular malformation, such as an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or a venous malformation, which can lead to bleeding.\n3. **Infection or inflammation**: Although you mentioned you had pain management and physical therapy after the surgery, it's possible that there was an underlying infection or inflammation that was not fully resolved.

This is because the immune system responds to allergens by activating lymphoid tissues, which can lead to swelling.\n2. Tender glands: The tenderness you're experiencing could be due to the inflammation and swelling caused by the hayfever.\n3. Mild sore throat and cough: These symptoms are common in people with hayfever, especially when they're exposed to allergens like pollen. The cough might be exacerbated by the dry air and dust you're exposed to while working outdoors.\n4. Variation in symptoms: The fact that your symptoms seem to worsen on certain days and improve on others suggests that they might be related to your exposure to allergens and environmental factors.\n\nGiven the normal results from your blood tests and chest X-ray, it's possible that your GP is correct in attributing your symptoms to hayfever and your outdoor work. However, I would recommend a few additional steps to confirm the diagnosis:\n\n1. Allergy testing: Consider getting an allergy test, such",

In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that semen samples should be collected at a healthcare facility or a laboratory setting, but it's not a legal requirement.\n\nHowever, there are some valid reasons why the hospital might have rejected your sample:\n\n1. **Quality control**: Hospitals have strict quality control measures in place to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the semen analysis. They may have concerns about the temperature, handling, and storage of the sample if it's collected at home and brought to the hospital.\n2. **Contamination risk**: When a semen sample is collected at home, there's a higher risk of contamination, which can affect the accuracy of the test results.\n3. **Standardized procedures**: Hospitals follow standardized procedures for collecting and handling semen samples, which ensures consistency and accuracy.

Based on the information you've provided, I'd like to offer some insights and recommendations.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to note that your father's creatinine level of 1.54 mg/dL is slightly elevated, which may indicate some degree of kidney dysfunction. However, it's not alarmingly high, and his BUN level of 12 mg/dL is also within the normal range.\n\nGiven that his urine analysis shows no proteinuria (protein in the urine) or hematuria (blood in the urine), it's less likely that the elevation in creatinine is due to kidney damage or disease. However, it's still important to investigate the cause of this elevation.\n\nThere are several potential explanations for the elevated creatinine level, including:\n\n1. Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR): As your father's liver function is stable, it's possible that his kidneys are not functioning optimally due to decreased GFR.\n2. Medication-induced kidney damage: Certain medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diuretics, or antibiotics, can cause kidney damage or reduce kidney function.\n3. Dehydration: Mild dehydration can cause an elevation",

The pain is often described as a sharp, stabbing sensation.\n2. Slight swelling: Mild swelling in the left leg is consistent with plantar fasciitis, as the condition can cause inflammation in the heel and surrounding tissues.\n3. Onset: The sudden onset of symptoms over a period of two weeks is consistent with plantar fasciitis, which can develop rapidly due to overuse, trauma, or poor foot mechanics.\n4. Psoriasis: While psoriasis is not directly related to plantar fasciitis, it's possible that the inflammation and irritation caused by the condition could exacerbate your psoriasis symptoms.\n\nPlantar fasciitis is often caused by repetitive strain or overuse, which can lead to inflammation and degeneration of the plantar fascia, a band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot.

        "generated": "\n\nI'm happy to help you with your concerns!\n\nFirstly, it's understandable that you're worried about the potential risks of cross-contamination during your root canal procedure. However, it's essential to understand that the scenario you described is a common practice in dentistry, and it's not necessarily a cause for concern.\n\nThe blue box you mentioned is likely a caliper or a measurement device used to measure the length of the root canal. It's not uncommon for dentists to use a shared caliper to measure the length of multiple canals, especially if they're working on multiple teeth in a single session.\n\nRegarding the potential for cross-contamination, it's true that there is a risk of transferring bacteria from one patient to another if the caliper is not properly cleaned and disinfected between uses. However, dentists are trained to follow strict protocols for sterilization and disinfection to minimize this risk.\n\nThat being said, it's still possible that the blue box was not properly cleaned and disinfected, which could have contributed to the sores you're experiencing. I would recommend speaking with your dentist about your concerns and asking them to explain their sterilization and disinfection protocols for the caliper and other equipment used during your procedure.\n\nIf you're still concerned",

PSE can cause encephalopathy, confusion, and coma. Although your patient's liver enzymes are only slightly elevated, it's essential to consider PSE as a potential cause.\n2. **Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)**: Similar to PSE, HE is a condition that occurs when the liver is unable to remove toxins, including ammonia, from the blood. This can cause encephalopathy, including coma. In patients with liver disease, HE can be triggered by factors such as constipation, infection, or medications.\n3. **Reye's Syndrome**: Although rare in adults, Reye's Syndrome is a life-threatening condition that can cause encephalopathy, including coma, in the setting of liver disease.

In cases like yours with an ankle sprain and then continued pain, it is most likely that there was some soft tissue damage on the structures that support the ankle joint itself. There is a ligament and two tendons on the outside of the ankle that are the main stabilizers, and these structures can get stretched, partially torn, or completely torn with a sprain. Most times, these will scar back down and continue to support the ankle. Other times, they will not be able to do the job as they did before and will have to work \\\"overtime\\\" to do the same job. This area then gets inflamed and painful, especially after a full day of trying to stabilize the joint (being on the feet all day). It is wise to start out with an ankle brace and see if that helps the area, as the brace can do the job of these soft tissue structures and give them a break to help decrease inflammation/pain. I hope this answer helped, if you have any further questions, I am here to help. Thank you.",

Ankle impingement occurs when the soft tissues in the ankle joint become inflamed and irritated, causing pain and stiffness. Ankle osteoarthritis, on the other hand, is a degenerative condition that occurs when the cartilage in the ankle joint wears away, leading to bone-on-bone contact and pain.\n\nGiven that you have a pre-existing ankle injury and are now experiencing worsening symptoms, it's possible that the ankle impingement or osteoarthritis has developed over time.\n\nAs for what you can do to relieve the pain, here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Rest and ice: Give your ankle a break and avoid activities that aggravate the pain. Apply ice packs to the affected area for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times a day to reduce inflammation.\n2. Stretching and exercises: Gentle stretching and exercises can help improve ankle mobility and reduce stiffness. You can try ankle circles, toe raises, and calf stretches.\n3.

It's great that you've started incorporating physical activity into your routine, and it's wonderful that you're taking steps to address your abdominal pain.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that your ESR range of 75 is slightly elevated, which may indicate some underlying inflammation. However, since your other blood tests and imaging studies are normal, it's likely that the elevated ESR is not a cause for concern.\n\nRegarding your abdominal pain, there are a few possibilities to consider:\n\n1. **Muscle strain**: It's possible that you've strained your abdominal muscles, particularly the external obliques, due to the sudden increase in exercise intensity and duration. This can cause muscle soreness and stiffness, especially when you cough or twist.\n2. **Pelvic floor dysfunction**: As you've started walking, your pelvic floor muscles may be adjusting to the new demands. This can lead to muscle tension and pain in the abdomen, hips, and back.\n3. **Poor posture**: If you're not maintaining good posture while walking or standing, it can put strain on your abdominal muscles, leading to pain and discomfort.\n\nGiven your symptoms, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. **Take a break from",

While surgery is often the most effective way to remove a mass or polyp, there are some alternative options that your doctor may consider, depending on the size and location of the mass, as well as your overall health.\n\nGiven that the mass has shrunk with medication, it's possible that it may be possible to continue monitoring it with regular imaging studies and medication, rather than undergoing surgery immediately. Your doctor may recommend a combination of medications, including corticosteroids and antibiotics, to help manage the mass and prevent it from growing back.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that if the mass is causing significant symptoms, such as nasal congestion, sinus pressure, or facial pain, surgery may still be necessary to alleviate these symptoms and improve your quality of life.\n\nIn terms of alternative options to surgery, your doctor may consider the following:\n\n1. Balloon sinuplasty: This is a minimally invasive procedure that uses a balloon catheter to dilate the sinus passages and remove any blockages. It's often used to treat chronic sinusitis and may be an option if the mass is not too large.\n2. Endoscopic sinus surgery: This is",

Given your family history, it's reasonable to suspect that there might be a hereditary component.\n\n1. **Cardiac factors:** Your slow pulse (upper 40s) and referral to a cardiologist are concerning. A slow heart rate can be a sign of various cardiac conditions, such as sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular (AV) block, or heart block. It's possible that your slow pulse is related to a cardiac issue, which might be contributing to your syncopal episodes.\n2. **Neurological factors:** Your brother's subdural hematoma, your sister's seizure-like petit mal episodes, and your father's frequent fainting suggest a possible neurological link. The fact that these episodes seem to be occurring in multiple family members raises the possibility of an inherited neurological condition.\n3. **Vasovagal syncope:** Vasovagal syncope is a common cause of fainting",

However, they can be cosmetically distressing and may require treatment to alleviate symptoms.\n\nGiven your cousin's history of multiple lipomas, I would recommend the following treatment options:\n\n1. **Surgical excision**: This is a common treatment for lipomas, where the affected area is surgically removed. The procedure is usually done under local anesthesia, and the lipoma is removed in its entirety. This option is particularly effective for larger lipomas that are causing discomfort or cosmetic concerns.\n2. **Steroid injections**: Corticosteroid injections can help reduce the size of lipomas by reducing inflammation and compressing the fatty tissue. This treatment is usually done in a series of injections, spaced 2-3 weeks apart, and can be effective for smaller lipomas.\n3. **Liposuction**: This is a minimally invasive procedure that involves removing the lipoma through a small",

If you are concerned about your symptoms, I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.\n\nStress can indeed cause physical symptoms, including chest pain. When we experience stress, our body's \"fight or flight\" response is triggered, releasing hormones like adrenaline and cortisol.

If you're experiencing recurring or severe chest pain, it's essential to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n\nSince you're taking Ativan (lorazepam) and it helps alleviate your symptoms, it's possible that your chest pain is related to anxiety.

Use a detergent-based or bleach-based disinfectant: As you were told by the CDC, detergent-based or bleach-based disinfectants are effective against the Ebola virus. Look for products that contain 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) or 4-6% quaternary ammonium compounds (quats).\n2.

This can help reduce discomfort and irritation.\n3. Wear loose, breathable clothing: Avoid wearing tight or synthetic clothing that can rub against the affected area and cause irritation. Instead, opt for loose, breathable clothing made of natural fibers like cotton or silk.\n4. Take regular breaks: If you're experiencing discomfort while walking, try taking regular breaks to sit down and rest. This can help reduce pressure on the affected area and give you a chance",

He has received three cycles of chemotherapy with Doxorubicin, but unfortunately, the treatment has not shown any significant response in reducing the size of the nodules in his lungs or affecting the primary tumor in his wrist.\n\nGiven the lack of response to chemotherapy and the denial of lung surgery due to the non-effectiveness of the treatment, we need to consider alternative treatment options for Mr. Rishav Srivastava.\n\nHere are a few potential treatment options that may be considered:\n\n1. Targeted therapy: Given the genetic characteristics of ASPS, targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may be a viable option. TKIs can target specific molecular pathways that are driving the growth of the tumor.\n2. Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors or other immunomodulatory agents may also be considered. These treatments can stimulate the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells",

Kidney stones can sometimes remain in the kidney or ureter for an extended period, causing recurring symptoms or no symptoms at all. The fact that you stopped monitoring your urine output and didn't pass the stone doesn't necessarily mean it's gone. However, it's also possible that the stone has passed, and the pain has resolved.\n\nRegarding the new sensation you're experiencing, it's possible that it could be related to the kidney stone or a separate issue. The sensation you described, feeling like an urge to push or a different sensation in the genital area, could be due to several factors:\n\n1. Residual stone fragments: If the stone has broken down into smaller pieces, they could still be present in your urinary tract, causing discomfort or pressure.\n2. Irritation or inflammation: Even if the stone has passed, the surrounding tissues may still be inflamed or irritated, leading to the sensation you're experiencing.\n3.

For example, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sensation of holding an object in your hand.\n2. **Deep breathing exercises**: Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.

High blood pressure can lead to increased blood viscosity, which can reduce blood flow to muscles and organs, causing fatigue. Additionally, high blood pressure can also lead to anemia, which is a common comorbidity, especially in older adults.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider other factors that could be contributing to your fatigue. As you mentioned, your sedentary lifestyle this winter could be a significant factor. Prolonged periods of inactivity can lead to decreased physical fitness, which can cause fatigue. Furthermore, a lack of physical activity can also contribute to decreased energy levels and increased fatigue.\n\nThe headaches you're experiencing could be related to your hypertension, but it's also possible that they're due to other factors such as dehydration, stress, or even sinus issues. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause of your headaches.\n\nGiven your history of being an avid hiker, it's likely that your fatigue is, at least partially, due to your sedentary lifestyle this winter. I would recommend gradually increasing your physical activity levels to get back to your usual routine",

However, losing 36 pounds in 5 months is quite significant. There are several factors that could contribute to your weight loss, and I'll discuss a few possibilities with you.\n\n1. **Lisinopril**: It's unlikely that Lisinopril is the primary cause of your weight loss. While Lisinopril can cause some side effects like cough, fatigue, and increased potassium levels, weight loss is not typically a reported side effect. Additionally, Lisinopril is primarily used to treat hypertension, not weight loss.\n2. **Anxiety**: Anxiety can indeed cause weight loss, especially if you're experiencing increased stress levels. When you're anxious, your body's \"fight or flight\" response is triggered, which can lead to increased cortisol production. Elevated cortisol levels can contribute to weight loss, particularly in the abdominal area.

It's estimated that up to 20% of patients receiving chemotherapy develop a blood clot.\n\nIn your sister's case, the blood clot is likely related to the chemotherapy she's receiving, rather than a sign of cancer spread. Chemotherapy can increase the risk of blood clots by:\n\n1. Reducing blood platelet count: Chemotherapy can lower the number of platelets in the blood, making it more difficult for blood to clot properly.\n2. Increasing blood viscosity: Chemotherapy can increase the thickness of blood, making it more prone to clotting.\n3.

It's not uncommon to experience some unusual symptoms after surgery, and the symptoms you're describing are worth investigating.\n\nThe warm and red appearance of your upper arms could be due to several reasons, and I'll try to address the most likely possibilities:\n\n1. **Vasodilation**: After surgery, your body's blood vessels may dilate (widen) to compensate for the increased blood flow required for healing. This can cause a temporary increase in blood flow to the arms, leading to warmth and redness. This is usually a benign and self-limiting condition.\n2. **Hormonal changes**: During surgery, your body releases hormones to help with the healing process. These hormonal changes can cause blood vessels to dilate, leading to increased blood flow and warmth in certain areas, including the arms.\n3. **Lymphatic system response**: The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in removing excess fluids and proteins from the body after surgery. In some cases, the lymphatic system may become overactive, leading to increased blood flow and warmth in the arms.\n4. **Post-operative swelling**: It's possible that you're experiencing swelling in the arms due to the surgery, which can cause warmth",

A normal blood pressure for a healthy adult is typically considered to be less than 120/80 mmHg.\n\nYour diastolic pressure of 67 mmHg is also elevated. A normal diastolic pressure is typically considered to be less than 80 mmHg.\n\nGiven your recent readings, it's concerning that your blood pressure has been fluctuating significantly over the past 12 hours, with a reading as low as 57 mmHg. This could be indicative of a condition known as orthostatic hypotension, which is a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up.\n\nAs a 43-year-old female with no known heart problems, it's essential to have your blood pressure checked by a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to these fluctuations.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids to help regulate your blood pressure.\n2. Avoid standing for long periods or getting up quickly, as this can exacerbate orthostatic hypotension.\n3. Consider elevating your legs while sitting or lying down to help improve blood flow and reduce symptoms.\n4",

And both can be seen after TB infection. When atelectasis involves terminal bronchioles, it is known as subsegment atelectasis. And the most common cause for this is retained secretions. So for visa purpose, I advise you to consult pulmonologist and get done CT THORAX and Bronchoscopy and BAD (Bronchi Alveolar Lavage) analysis for TB. As both will be needed to rule out active TB infection.",

Subsegmental atelectasis refers to the collapse of a small branch of a bronchus, which is a smaller airway that branches off from a larger airway. In this case, the left lower lobe is the affected area.\n\nSubsegmental atelectasis can be caused by several factors, including:\n\n* Mucus plugging or bronchial obstruction\n* Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung)\n* Pneumonia or other infections\n* Lung injury or trauma\n* Chronic lung diseases such as COPD or asthma\n\n**What is left lower lobe subsegmental fibrosis?**\n\nFibrosis is a condition where scar tissue forms in the lung, leading to permanent damage and stiffness. In this case, the left lower lobe is the affected area.\n\nSubsegmental fibrosis can be caused by:\n\n* Chronic inflammation or infection\n* Lung injury or trauma\n* Environmental toxins or pollutants",

Based on your symptoms and previous surgeries, I'll do my best to provide you with some insights and potential next steps.\n\nFirstly, it's impressive that you've made significant lifestyle changes and lost over 50 pounds. This can have a positive impact on your overall health and potentially alleviate some of your back pain.\n\nGiven your history of L4-5 disc bulge/herniation, discetomy, and limited laminectomy, it's not surprising that you're experiencing recurring back pain and limited mobility. The fact that you've had two previous surgeries and have been experiencing symptoms for over 20 years suggests that your condition is chronic.\n\nThe MRI findings from 2002, which showed generalized bulging of the remaining intervertebral disc at the L4-5 level, are consistent with degenerative disc disease. This can lead to ongoing back pain and stiffness.\n\nThe recent symptoms you're experiencing, including low back pressure and pain, pain in your right buttock, and pain radiating down your right leg, are likely related to your degenerative disc disease and potentially the early stages of facet joint arthritis.\n\nIn terms of your prognosis, it's difficult to predict with certainty what the future holds.

When you're feeling anxious, your body's \"fight or flight\" response is activated, which can cause your heart rate to increase.\n2. **Electrical irregularities**: Your heart's electrical system can sometimes misfire, leading to abnormal heart rhythms. This can cause palpitations.\n3. **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations, particularly during times of stress or changes in your menstrual cycle, can affect your heart rate and lead to palpitations.\n4. **Caffeine or nicotine**: Consuming caffeine or nicotine can cause palpitations, especially in people who are sensitive to these substances.\n5. **Underlying medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidism, arrhythmias, or mitral valve prol",

Given your recent surgery and underlying diabetes, it's essential to prioritize your recovery and take precautions to minimize complications. Here's some guidance on how to prevent pancreatitis and damage to other organs:\n\n**Why gallbladder removal can increase the risk of pancreatitis:**\n\n1. **Bile duct disruption:** During gallbladder removal, the bile ducts may be disrupted, leading to bile leaking into the pancreatic duct. This can cause inflammation and damage to the pancreas, resulting in pancreatitis.\n2. **Increased pancreatic enzyme production:** Without a gallbladder, bile is not stored and concentrated, which can lead to an increase in pancreatic enzyme production. This can cause the pancreas to work harder, increasing the risk of pancreatitis.\n3. **Impaired digestion:** Gallbladder removal can lead to impaired digestion, as bile is not released into the small intestine to help break down fats. This can cause malabsorption of nutrients, leading to inflammation and damage to other organs.\n\n**Prevention measures:**\n\n1. **Follow your surgeon's instructions:** Adhere to your surgeon's post-operative instructions, including any dietary restrictions or medications.\n2. **Take pancreatic enzymes:** Your doctor may",

This is called calculus cholecystitis, meaning there is an inflamed gall bladder without the stones in the gal bladder, Another option is the stones were so small that they caused the inflammation and passed out into the bile ducts causing an obstruction and hence the swelling of the liver also. I would advise going for the relevant blood tests to know the status of liven biochemically and a repeat ultrasonography to know the status of the common bile duct / pancreas.",
        "generated": "\n\nThank you for reaching out, Sandra. I'd be happy to help you understand the potential connection between your recent gallbladder attack and the swollen liver.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to note that the absence of gallstones on the ultrasound doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't any gallstones present. It's possible that the stones were too small to be detected or that they were in a location that didn't allow for clear visualization.\n\nRegarding the correlation between your gallbladder attack and the swollen liver, there are a few possible explanations:\n\n1. **Bile duct obstruction**: During your gallbladder attack, it's possible that the gallbladder contracted and released bile into the bile ducts, causing temporary obstruction. This obstruction could have led to increased pressure in the liver, causing it to swell. As the obstruction resolves, the liver swelling may also resolve.\n2. **Inflammation and edema**: The acute gallbladder attack could have triggered an inflammatory response in the liver, leading to swelling and edema. This is a common phenomenon in many inflammatory conditions.\n3. **Underlying liver disease**: Although you mentioned that your diet is bland, it's possible that you may have an underlying liver condition, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease",

But I will try to explain you something. It is quite known in cardiology that stent stenosis might happen. This risk is higher during the first 6 months and then decreases. But there are other possibilities after a stent re-stenosis like angioplasty with balloon, stent-intra stent implantation that mean that you might implant a stent into the obstructed stent, always depending on the type of your first stent and the characteristic of the stenosis. And the last option when the other are not possible is by-pass surgery that you all ready know. So, yes...if your three arteries have problems and your stents get stenosis you might end to bypass surgery. If this is technically possible or not depends on the characteristics of your coronary arteries and the positions of stenosis. The risk of bypass surgery depends on your age, your heart function and other organs functions. But you should not worry. You do have possibilities to go quite well. There are a lot of possibilities today with a good chronic medical treatment, angioplasty and by pas' surgery. Wish I was helpful. Best regards.",

This may involve adjusting your medication, diet, or lifestyle habits to reduce symptoms.\n2. **Asthma management**: Continue to use your albuterol inhaler as prescribed, but consider increasing the frequency or dose if your symptoms persist. Your doctor may also recommend adding a corticosteroid inhaler to help reduce inflammation.\n3. **Combine asthma and GERD treatment**: Consider combining your asthma and GERD treatments.

        "expected": "Hello, Sorry to hear about the list of injuries you faced. Coming to the point, you mentioned that MRI is suggestive of Lumbar and cervical disc degenerative changes. Let's discuss this first and then the rest. What my experience taught me over a period of 12 years with cases related to injuries like you and others I will give my suggestion. First foremost, buy a soft neck collar and start using it. This will stabilize the bones of the cervical region and also will act as s support to the muscular system to allow less compression over the nerve. The disc injuries are most times self-healing, once the inflammation subsides you should not feel much pain. When using neck collar I will advise you to use on/off hot water fermentation so that the muscled which have undergone spasm will relax, and the pain will come down slowly. Along with this. You have lumbar disc degenerative changes, so why don't you first take hot water fermentation so that the muscles of the lumbar region gets relaxed and make you at least stable. Post this use 3-4 pillows and try McKenzie maneuver in passive way. The details of McKenzie you can find over the net. This will help centralize the pain and once the pain is centralized you can use hot water bag to again soothe the nerve roots. Once nerve root is relaxed the pain travelling in its course will reduce automatically. Post which after 5-7 days of doing this you can focus on exercises, but please continue the above advice as well. Exercise should focus on core stability, lower limb strengthening, upper limb strengthening and neck muscle strengthening. Slowly you will develop strength also and the inflammation on the nerve root will be reduced leading to the end result of improved lifestyle. If your pain symptoms are too high then a nerve block may be administered to the nerve root which may block the pain sensation for a couple of months. But if the muscles remain week still, it will again come back so doing the above-mentioned exercise will be of help to avoid recurrence of pain symptoms. Coming to the surgical management, there is possibility of removal of the torn disc element and also fusing the spine, but this may not make you get rid of the pain over all for long. The pain will be present throughout the life and need exercise for the same. This option I do not recommend unless and until the motor functions are compromised. Also, very important is the diet, what you eat is to be focused. Having food which can digest faster without leading to any gastritis should be kept in mind. As with gastritis there may be leading to two symptoms, one compression over the nerve in the lower spine and headache. Having a good diet plan will be good. Please do not ignore the hip and knee muscles as you have the replacement done in the past and the muscles are weak this may aggravate the spine curvature to deviate and lead to other symptoms. Coming to your ankle, I cannot comment much as the history is too brief to guide over anything. I am sorry for it. Please contact a local physical therapist who can show interest in you and give the maximum output. I have tried my best to put forth the best possible treatment plan which should help you. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.",

It's normal for breastfed babies to have a delay in their bowel movements, especially in the first few weeks.\n2. **Frequency of wet diapers:** It's great that your baby is wetting his diaper 3 times a day. This indicates that he's still getting enough milk and hydration.\n3. **Consult your pediatrician:** If you're concerned about your baby's bowel movements or overall health, it's always best to consult with your pediatrician.

In your son's case, the fact that he's passing stool regularly and without any other symptoms suggests that it's likely due to his fascination with hair rather than a medical issue.\n\nHere are a few possible explanations:\n\n1. **Hair ingestion**: Children often put things in their mouths, including hair. If your son has been playing with your long blond hair, it's possible that he's accidentally ingested some strands, which can then pass through his digestive system and end up in his stool.\n2. **Environmental contamination**: Hair can be present in the environment, especially in carpets, upholstery, or other areas where hair tends to accumulate.

        "expected": "Hello understand your concern. What you describe is called a paresthesia, an odd sensation when a particular area of your body is touched.  There are multiple causes of paresthesia, including neurological, vitamin deficiencies and even psychological. If you have seen many physicians already, I assume you had blood tests to check thyroid, B12 level, calcium level, magnesium level, iron level, as well as kidney and liver functions.  Some liver and kidney conditions could cause paresthesia. Also, some autoimmune diseases cause similar symptoms such as lupus or polymyalgia rheumatic. Next is to get electromyelograms with nerve conducting velocities of your arms or legs.  This will help identify any problem with your nerves or muscles. Some types of naturopathies cause parasomnias.  Do you have any medical conditions or are you on any medications that could cause these symptoms? The causes as you can see are varied. You can also see a pain management specialist who can help with the paresthesia. I hope you feel better",

The fact that the numbness starts in the area where you feel something strange (like \"jijijiji\") suggests that there may be a neurological component to your symptoms.\n\nThe fact that you've visited multiple doctors in different countries without a clear diagnosis suggests that this may be a complex case. However, I'd like to ask some more questions to help narrow down the possibilities:\n\n1. Can you describe the sensation of \"jijijiji\" in more detail? Is it a feeling of electricity, vibration, or something else?\n2. How long does the numbness last after you sit or lie down? Is it constant, or does it come and go?\n3. Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as muscle weakness, cramping, or difficulty with coordination or balance?\n4. Have you experienced any trauma or injuries to your spine or nervous system?\n5. Have",

A normal TSH range is typically between 0.4 and 4.0 mU/L. A level of 94 is significantly above the normal range, indicating primary hypothyroidism.\n\nNow, let's explore the potential connection between your high TSH level and your sudden increase in blood pressure. Here are a few possible explanations:\n\n1. **Hypothyroidism-induced hypertension**: Hypothyroidism can cause increased blood pressure due to the following mechanisms:\n\t* Increased peripheral vascular resistance\n\t* Increased blood volume\n\t* Increased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity\n\t* Increased sympathetic nervous system activity\n2. **Thyroid hormone's role in blood pressure regulation**: Thyroid hormones, particularly triiodothyronine (T3), play a crucial role in regulating blood pressure. Hypothyroidism can lead to decreased T3 levels, which may contribute to increased blood pressure.\n3. **Other potential factors**: It's also possible that your high blood pressure was caused by other factors, such as:\n",

These patches are very resistant to treatment and once cleared with medicines there is always a possibility of its recurrence. There are various remedies, best is to use a broad spectrum sunscreen daily three times. At night one can use de-pigmenting creams only on the spot. These creams either contain HY Chat Doctor.

Remedies include using topical creams containing ingredients like hydroquinone, kojic acid, or retinoids, and protecting the skin from the sun.\n3. **Acne**: In some cases, acne can cause dark patches or scars on the skin.

It's understandable to feel worried about the increased cramping and discomfort.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to note that Mirena IUD is a hormone-releasing device that can cause changes in menstrual bleeding and cramping. In some cases, women may experience heavier or lighter bleeding, longer or shorter cycles, or changes in cramping. However, it's unusual to experience worsened cramping, especially on one side of the body.\n\nGiven your symptoms, I would like to consider a few possible explanations:\n\n1. **IUD migration or displacement**: Although rare, it's possible that the Mirena IUD has moved or displaced from its original position, which could cause cramping and discomfort on one side of the body. This could be due to the device being placed too high or too low in the uterus.\n2. **Infection or inflammation**: Bacterial or fungal infections can cause cramping, fever, and abdominal pain. In rare cases, infections can occur around the IUD, leading to inflammation and discomfort.\n3. **Perforation or embedment**: Although rare, it's possible that the M",

I'll do my best to provide you with some guidance.\n\nBased on your description, it seems that your brother is experiencing severe pain in both feet, which is likely related to his diagnosed sensory neuropathy disease. The fact that he can neither walk nor put his feet down suggests that he may be experiencing significant numbness, tingling, or weakness in his feet and legs.\n\nThe medication suggested by his family doctor, Eldervit 1.2 mg injection, is likely a pain management medication, possibly a local anesthetic or a pain reliever. The fact that it's recommended to be given once a week for 4 weeks suggests that his doctor is trying to manage his pain symptoms.\n\nAs a doctor, I would like to ask a few more questions to better understand your brother's condition:\n\n1. How long has your brother been experiencing these symptoms?\n2. Has he noticed any changes in his pain levels or symptoms over time?\n3. Has he experienced any other symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in his hands, arms, or legs?\n4. Has he had any recent injuries or trauma to his feet or legs?\n5.

Heat stress: Prolonged exposure to hot temperatures without proper cooling can cause heat stress, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and changes in blood flow to the inner ear.\n2. Inner ear damage: The extreme heat may have damaged the tiny calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) in your inner ear, which are responsible for maintaining balance and equilibrium. This damage can disrupt the normal functioning of the inner ear and cause BPPV symptoms.\n3. Canalithiasis",

I'll try to break down the possible reasons behind her symptoms and the lack of clear answers.\n\n**Malignant ascites:** Malignant ascites is a condition where fluid accumulates in the abdominal cavity due to the spread of cancer from an unknown primary site. In your friend's case, the ascites is likely caused by cancer cells that have broken away from the primary tumor and spread to the abdominal cavity.\n\n**PET scan:** A PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan uses a small amount of radioactive material to visualize the body's metabolic activity. In cancer, cells tend to have higher metabolic rates than normal cells, making them \"hot\" on a PET scan. However, there are several reasons why a PET scan might not show any \"hot spots\" in your friend's case:\n\n1. **Low-grade cancer:** The cancer cells may be producing very little metabolic activity, making them difficult to detect on a PET scan.\n2. **Infiltrative pattern:** Cancer cells may be infiltrating the surrounding tissues in a diffuse pattern, rather than forming a large mass that would show up on a PET",

Instead, let's focus on making sustainable lifestyle changes.\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you with weight loss:\n\n1. **Dietary changes**: While you mentioned you don't consume butter, ghee, or sweets, it's essential to pay attention to your overall diet. Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and whole grains. Aim to include a variety of colors on your plate to ensure you're getting a range of nutrients.\n2",

It's understandable that you're concerned about getting pregnant, especially after your previous experience.\n\nSince you're using oral pills, I need to clarify a few things. The effectiveness of oral pills depends on various factors, including the type of pill, its timing, and your individual response to it.\n\nIn your case, since you started taking the pill during the last few days of your 15th day of your cycle, there's a possibility that the pill might not have been effective in preventing pregnancy.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that oral pills are not 100% effective, and there's always a small chance of getting pregnant even when using them correctly.\n\nSince you're concerned about getting pregnant, I recommend that you take a pregnancy test to confirm whether you're pregnant or not. You can buy a home pregnancy test (HPT) from a pharmacy or a medical store.\n\nIf the test is positive, please don't panic!

However, there could be other factors affecting fertility.

You can try tracking her ovulation using basal body temperature (BBT) charts, ovulation predictor kits (OPKs), or a fertility app. This will help you identify the most fertile window.\n2. **Timing of intercourse**: For optimal conception, it's recommended to have intercourse every other day or every 2-3 days around ovulation. This increases the chances of sperm meeting the egg. Since your wife's last period started on January 18th, you can try having intercourse starting from around January 20th to January 25th.\n3. **Lifestyle factors**: Certain lifestyle factors can affect fertility.

Here are a few potential causes:\n\n1. Eczema (atopic dermatitis): The fact that the rash started as a bumpy, blistering rash between your fingers and spread to other areas of your body is consistent with eczema. Eczema can be triggered by a variety of factors, including allergies, stress, and environmental factors. The itching and scratching can lead to the formation of red marks.\n2. Contact dermatitis: As you mentioned, you suspected an allergy to washing powder. However, the fact that the rash is widespread and not limited to areas in contact with fabric suggests that this may not be the primary cause. Contact dermatitis can still be a possibility, especially if you're using a new laundry detergent or fabric softener.\n3. Seborrheic dermatitis: This is a chronic skin condition characterized by a",

However, if it's causing discomfort, pain, or other symptoms, your doctor may recommend further evaluation and treatment.\n\nIVF (In Vitro Fertilization) is a viable option for you, considering your history of miscarriage.

I guess your concern is about...can u have safe pregnancy after an infection and hormonal imbalance post miscarriage.right.my answer is.YES.there are chances of safer pregnancy in the future. Usually after miscarriage it is routine that doctor will advise for ultrasound to conform that whether is miscarriage is COMPLETE (that means all products of conception are expelled out from the womb) or INCOMPLETE (there is retained product of conception inside the womb). In both the cases usually antibiotics are prescribed to prevent infection and incomplete miscarriage usually required minor surgery for removal of retained products so that chances of infection further decreases. As u told that u had miscarriage in last year, but u didn't give whether it was complete or incomplete. U had taken antibiotics or not. So it is difficult for me to comment on this. After miscarriage there is hormonal imbalance usually happens, but in most of the cases it will correct spontaneously. Some women required medication for correlation of it. This hormonal imbalance usually effects the menses, due to that menses will be irregular.u told that u have hormonal imbalance but didn't give info regarding your menses whether it is regular or irregular. So it is difficult for me to comment on this.u also told that u have taking separate which cause pain in your abs, for that u can take alternative medicine after discussing with your treating doctor.

Meprate (mifepristone) is a medication commonly used to support pregnancy, especially in cases of miscarriage or implantation failure.\n\nRegarding your abdominal pain after taking Meprate, it's not uncommon to experience mild cramping or discomfort due to the medication. Mifepristone works by blocking the action of progesterone, which can cause uterine contractions and lead to cramping. However, if the pain is severe or persists, it's essential to consult your doctor to rule out any underlying issues.\n\nAs for your question about having a safe pregnancy, it's crucial to discuss your medical history and any concerns with your healthcare provider. Since you've had a miscarriage and hormonal imbalance in the past, it's essential to monitor your pregnancy closely to ensure a healthy outcome.\n\nTo minimize the risk of complications, your healthcare provider may recommend:\n\n1.

These symptoms are most probably due to compression and collapse of vertebrae, collection of pus in spinal canal and compression of nerves. To get relief, you should-Avoid any kind of weight-bearing- Avoid flexion and extension at spine-Wear back supporting belt like thoracolumbar corset.- For pain relief, you can take tablet pregabalin after proper prescription. Usual adult is 75 to 150 mg twice a day. If still no relief, you can take tablet amitriptyline after proper prescription.- For cramps, do physiotherapy and take tablet baclofen after proper prescription.- Also increase your protein and calcium intake for strengthening bones. If still no relief and symptoms worsen, repeat MRI spine to rule out any progressively increasing compression of spinal cord or nerves.

Patellar tendinitis is an inflammation of the tendon that connects the kneecap (patella) to the shinbone (tibia). This can cause sharp, stabbing pains in the knee, especially when climbing stairs, squatting, or jumping.\n\nGiven your history of osteoarthritis, it's possible that the tendinitis is exacerbated by the wear and tear on your knee joint. The electrical shock-like sensation you described could be due to the sudden stretching or irritation of the tendon.\n\nThe fact that the pain is random and only occurs when you're walking uphill or climbing stairs suggests that it may be related to the increased stress and strain on your knee joint during these activities.\n\nSince you've already tried icing, elevating, and stretching, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Continue to ice and elevate your knee to reduce inflammation and pain.\n2. Consider taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to help reduce inflammation and pain.\n3. Modify your exercise routine to avoid activities that exacerbate the pain, such as walking uphill or climbing stairs.\n4. Consider physical therapy",

TB treatment, in particular, can cause liver damage in some cases. Jaundice, which is often a sign of liver dysfunction, may have also caused chronic liver damage.\n\nHowever, without further testing and evaluation, it's difficult to say for certain whether your past illnesses are the sole cause of your high SGOT level.

The X-ray findings indicating that your spine resembles that of a 90-year-old are likely due to the natural aging process, which can cause wear and tear on the spinal discs.\n\nRegarding Instaflex, it's a supplement that claims to provide joint and back support, among other benefits. While some people may experience positive effects from taking Instaflex, it's crucial to approach any supplement with a healthy dose of skepticism.\n\nAs a healthcare professional, I would advise you to consult with your primary care physician or a rheumatologist to discuss your options for managing your DDD. They can help you develop a personalized plan that may include a combination of the following:\n\n1. Lifestyle modifications: Maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and practicing good posture can help alleviate back strain.\n2. Stretching and strengthening exercises: Gentle exercises can help improve flexibility and strengthen the muscles around your spine.\n3. Pain management",

It is natures rule, as we get older the functions of our body will be decreased quantitatively and qualitatively. The ovaries also decrease in its function as women become old. The reproductive age group, that is maximum chances of conceiving is more usually at 20 to 40 years.  Around the age of 50 to 52 years, women stop her menses. This indicates she can't conceive anymore. The age 45-48 years is a transition zone from highly reproductive age group to the age group where menses stop.

This deficiency does not have any direct connection to the metabolism or processing of alcohol.\n\nThe liver is responsible for metabolizing alcohol, and this process is primarily mediated by enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and cytochrome P450. Pseudocholinesterase deficiency does not affect the activity of these enzymes, and therefore, it is unlikely to impact the liver's ability to process alcohol.\n\nThere is no scientific evidence to suggest that pseudocholinesterase deficiency can accelerate liver problems or worsen the effects of alcohol on the liver. The relationship between liver cirrhosis and alcohol consumption is well-established, and it is primarily caused by chronic and excessive alcohol consumption, which leads to oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver.\n\nIt's possible that the doctor who treated your relative may have misspoken or misinterpreted the relationship between pseudocholinesterase deficiency and liver disease.

        "expected": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, The ultrasound report suggests that there is dilatation of the left pelvis and left ureter. Dilatation of pelvi-calyceal system is seen in case of obstruction at level below the region of dilatation. The most common cause of obstruction is kidney stones. Other common causes include an intramural mass or an extra-mural mass compressing the ureter. Further investigations are required to find out the cause of obstruction. Consult a surgeon or a urologist for relevant investigations and further management. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.",
        "generated": "\n\nBased on the ultrasound report, I'll break down what it means and what could be potential concerns:\n\n1. **Dilated pelvis and proximal hydroureter**: This indicates that the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) is widened and dilated, especially in the proximal part (near the kidney). This can be due to various reasons, such as:\n\t* Obstruction: A blockage in the ureter, often caused by a kidney stone, tumor, or scar tissue, can cause urine to back up and dilate the ureter.\n\t* Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR): A condition where urine flows backward from the bladder into the ureter, causing dilatation.\n\t* Neurogenic bladder: A condition where the bladder muscle is weakened, leading to urinary retention and dilation of the ureter.\n2. **Left kidney measures 37mm**: This is slightly larger than the normal range for a 32-week fetus, but it's not significantly larger. However, the dilatation of the pelvis and ureter might be causing some concern.\n3. **Right kidney measures 35mm**: This is within the normal range for a 32-week fetus.\n4.",

The endometrial thickness of 7.8mm is also within the normal range.\n\nSince you took 5000 IU of Hucog injection two days back, it's likely that the follicle is responding well to the stimulation.\n\nAs for when your follicle is likely to rupture and when you can proceed with intercourse, here's a general guideline:\n\n* Typically, follicles with a size of 20-22mm are considered mature and ready for ovulation.\n* Ovulation usually occurs 24-48 hours after the follicle reaches maturity.\n* Based on this, it's likely that your follicle will rupture and ovulate within the next 24-48 hours.\n\nAs for when you can proceed with intercourse, it's generally recommended to wait until after ovulation has occurred. This is because sperm can survive inside the female reproductive tract for up to 5-7 days, and ovulation usually occurs around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle.\n\nConsidering you've taken the Hucog injection two days back, it's likely that ovulation will occur within the next 24-48 hours",

I suggest you also get an MRI scan of your pelvis with the recommendation of your doctor and then do endometrial biopsy.

It's a common condition, especially in people who are overweight or obese, have type 2 diabetes, or consume excessive amounts of alcohol.\n\nArimidex (anastrozole) is a medication commonly used to treat breast cancer, particularly hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. It's a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that works by reducing the production of estrogen in the body. While Arimidex is generally well-tolerated, it can cause various side effects, including changes in liver function.\n\nThere have been reports of Arimidex use being associated with an increased risk of developing fatty liver. A 2019 study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that women taking Arimidex had a higher incidence of fatty liver compared to those taking tamoxifen, another type of breast cancer medication. Another study published in the Journal of Breast Cancer Research and Treatment in 2017 reported that Arimidex use was associated with an increased risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n\n",

A graft dysfunction could be due to various reasons, such as chronic rejection, chronic allograft nephropathy, or vascular complications.\n2. **Perinephric fluid collection**: After nephrectomy, it's possible that a fluid collection (e.g., hematoma or seroma) could have developed in the perinephric space, which",

However, it's crucial to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Morning sickness and travel:** If you're experiencing severe morning sickness, flying might exacerbate your symptoms. You may want to discuss medication options with your healthcare provider to help manage your symptoms.\n2. **Air pressure and changes in altitude:** Some women may experience discomfort or nausea due to the changes in air pressure and altitude during flights. This is usually mild and temporary, but it's essential to be aware of it.\n3. **Risk of miscarriage:** While flying is generally considered safe, there's a theoretical risk of miscarriage associated with air travel. However, this risk is extremely low, and most experts agree that flying does not increase the risk of miscarriage.\n4. **Your",

The spotting could be a sign of implantation bleeding, which occurs when a fertilized egg implants itself in the uterus.\n\nAs for your chances of pregnancy, it's difficult to determine with certainty without a medical evaluation.

Physical therapy: A physical therapist can help you maintain muscle strength, flexibility, and range of motion to reduce the risk of further paralysis.\n3. Medications: In some cases, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms such as pain, muscle spasms, or respiratory problems.\n4. Orthotics and assistive devices: If you experience paralysis or muscle weakness, you may need to use orthotics, such as braces or splints, to support your limbs.\n\nAcupressure, on the other hand, is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves",

However, I do have some concerns regarding his recent symptoms and vomiting episode.\n\nThe fact that he vomited once on Saturday and had loose stools since then, followed by frequent trips to the bathroom between 5 pm and 11 pm last night, suggests that his symptoms may not be fully resolved. Enterogermina is a probiotic medication that helps to restore the balance of good bacteria in the gut, but it's not a treatment for underlying conditions that may be causing his symptoms.\n\nI would recommend that you consult with his pediatrician or healthcare provider to discuss his symptoms and determine the underlying cause. It's possible that your son may have an underlying condition such as gastroenteritis, food poisoning, or a viral infection that's causing his symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, it's essential to monitor your son's symptoms closely and ensure that he's staying hydrated by offering plenty of fluids, such as breast milk or formula for infants and toddlers.

The bacteria that caused the infection may have spread to the surrounding tissues, including the lymph nodes in your neck.\n\nThe knot you're feeling could be a swollen lymph node, which is a common response to infection. Lymph nodes are part of the immune system and help filter out pathogens and other foreign substances from the body. When an infection occurs, the lymph nodes can become swollen and tender as they try to fight off the infection.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the knot could be caused by other factors, such as:\n\n* A skin abscess or cyst: This could be a pocket of pus that has formed under the skin, often as a result of a skin infection or ingrown hair.\n* A sebaceous cyst: This is a type of cyst that forms when a sebaceous gland becomes blocked and fills with pus.\n* A lymphoma: This is a type of cancer that affects the immune system and can cause swollen lymph nodes.\n\nTo determine the cause of",

Memory can be affected by various factors, including genetics, age, lifestyle, and mental health.\n\nGiven your background and the challenges you faced after your father's passing, it's possible that you may be experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These conditions can significantly impact memory and cognitive function.\n\nHere are a few potential explanations for your memory issues:\n\n1. **Stress and anxiety**: Chronic stress and anxiety can disrupt normal memory processes, making it harder to recall information. This is because stress can activate the body's \"fight or flight\" response, which diverts blood flow and oxygen to the brain's emergency centers, leaving less resources for memory consolidation.\n2. **Sleep disturbances**: Poor sleep quality or insomnia can impair memory consolidation, making it harder to retain new information.

Cold and wet weather can make respiratory viruses more contagious and can also exacerbate existing respiratory infections.\n\nThe loss of voice and throat pain could be due to a viral laryngitis, which is a common complication of a cold.

The absence of a fever doesn't rule out the possibility of a bacterial infection, as some people may not develop a fever with bacterial infections.\n\nGiven her symptoms, it would be a good idea to have her seen by a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to her lingering symptoms.

There are only six reported cases of symptomatic recurrent anti-GBM disease in the literature. The incidence of recurrent linear Immunoglobulin G (Egg) staining in the transplant may be as high as 50 percent. However, most patients remain asymptomatic.

A kidney biopsy would provide more accurate information about the underlying cause of your kidney disease.\n\nRegarding the potential relationship between your skin disease and kidney disease, it's possible that there might be an association. However, without further evaluation and testing, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of this relationship.\n\nNow, regarding the impact of your skin disease on your new transplanted kidney:\n\n1. **Risk of recurrence**: In general, the risk of recurrence of anti-GBM antibody-mediated kidney disease in a transplanted kidney is low, around 1-5%. However, this risk is higher in cases where the underlying cause is not fully understood or if the disease is not adequately treated before transplantation.\n2. **Impact on graft function**: Your skin disease may not directly affect the function of your transplanted kidney. However, if you have a severe or uncontrolled skin disease, it may increase your risk of developing complications, such as infections or inflammation, which could potentially affect your graft function.\n3. **Immunosuppressive therapy**: After transplantation, you will need",

However, the exact definition of moderate dementia can vary depending on the specific criteria used, such as the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) or the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR).\n\nIn general, moderate dementia is considered to be a stage where the individual requires assistance with daily activities, such as bathing, dressing, and managing finances, but still has some ability to perform these tasks independently.\n\nRegarding the potential impact of anesthesia on your mother's dementia, it's possible that the anesthesia may have contributed to her cognitive decline, especially given the difficulties she experienced during the surgeries. However, it's essential to note that the relationship between anesthesia and dementia is still being studied, and more research is needed to fully understand the potential effects.\n\nAs for medications to slow the progression of dementia, there are several options available, including:\n\n1.

Depending on the size and location of the cyst, they may recommend one of the following options:\n\n1. Surgical excision: The doctor will remove the cyst in a surgical procedure, which may require local anesthesia or sedation.

Potassium is an essential electrolyte that plays a crucial role in maintaining proper heart function, muscle contractions, and nerve function.\n\nHowever, before starting any new medication, I would recommend discussing the following points with your doctor:\n\n1. **Monitoring**: It's essential to monitor your potassium levels regularly to ensure that the supplement is effective and safe.

Aim for 8-10 hours of sleep per night.\n2. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, herbal tea, or warm soup, to help loosen mucus and soothe your throat. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of fluid per day.\n3. **Use a humidifier**: Dry air can irritate your throat and make your cough worse. Using a humidifier can help add moisture to the air and relieve congestion.\n4. **Take over-the-counter medications**: Your doctor may recommend over-the-counter medications such as cough suppressants,",

I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand what might be going on.\n\nIt sounds like you've been experiencing knee pain, and despite some tests coming back normal, your doctor suspects that you might have low glucosamine levels, which could be contributing to your knee pain. He prescribed you Divido (a medication for osteoarthritis), Dorofen (an anti-inflammatory), and Mydocalm (a muscle relaxant) to help manage your symptoms.\n\nYou've been taking the Divido and Dorofen for 4 days, and suddenly, you're experiencing terrible stomach pain. You stopped taking the medication because of this discomfort. I understand your concern about needing these medications to prevent your knee pain, but it's essential to address the stomach issue first.\n\nHere are a few possible explanations for your stomach pain:\n\n1. **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Both Divido and Dorofen can cause gastrointestinal issues like stomach pain, nausea, or diarrhea. It's possible that your body is reacting to one or both of these medications.\n2. **Interactions with other medications or supplements**: You didn't mention taking any other medications or supplements, but it's essential to disclose everything you're taking to your doctor",

There are other dietary modifications required like avoiding excessive citrus fruits, curd, high protein diet etc. 2. Ask your doctor that you want to stop Tab febuxosatat, you are taking right now. He will guide you how to gradually reduce the dose of medicines. DON'T ABRUPTLY STOP MEDICINES. 3. Do serum uric acid levels every 3 monthly.

The pain subsiding after 20-30 seconds suggests that it may be related to joint stiffness rather than inflammation.\n\n**Uric Acid Level:**\nYour uric acid level of 7.0 is slightly elevated, but within the normal range. The pathologist's advice to take precautions with food habits and lifestyle is reasonable. This may include reducing or avoiding foods that are high in purines (e.g., organ meats, seafood, and certain vegetables), as well as increasing fluid intake to help flush out excess uric acid.\n\n**Prescribed Medications:**\nYou have been prescribed several medications, which I'll review:\n\n1. **FEBUGET 40 (allopurinol)**: This medication is typically used to treat gout and hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels). Since your uric acid level is within the normal range, it's unclear why this medication was prescribed. It's possible that your doctor was trying to prevent future increases in uric acid",

It's not uncommon for infants to experience indigestion and gas issues, especially around this age.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you've been following the doctor's advice and using the Decolic drops and Neopeptine suspension as prescribed. These medications can help alleviate symptoms of indigestion and gas.\n\nSince your baby was doing well yesterday but has become restless and crying a lot today, it's possible that the symptoms may have flared up or there might be an underlying issue that needs attention.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that may help:\n\n1. **Burp your baby more frequently**: Sometimes, babies can swallow air while feeding, which can lead to gas and discomfort. Try burping your baby more frequently, especially after feedings, to help release any trapped air.\n2. **Adjust the feeding position**: Make sure your baby is in a comfortable position while feeding. If your baby is lying down, try propping them up slightly or using a wedge pillow to help reduce gas and discomfort.\n3. **Check the formula or breastmilk**: If your baby is formula-fed, you might want to consider switching to a different formula or consulting with",

Since you've noticed an association between exercise and palpitations, it's possible that your heart is responding to the physical stress of running.\n\nGiven your age, height, and weight, you're generally at a low risk for cardiac issues. However, it's crucial to discuss your symptoms with your doctor and get a definitive diagnosis.\n\nIn the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your symptoms and keeping track of when they occur.

Low iron levels can indeed impact sperm count, motility, and morphology, as iron plays a crucial role in the production and function of sperm. \n\nRegarding your question, multivitamins typically don't contain iron for several reasons:\n\n1. **Dose:** Iron is a potent nutrient, and high doses can cause gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, diarrhea, and constipation. Multivitamins aim to provide a balanced blend of essential vitamins and minerals, and adding iron would increase the risk of adverse effects.\n2. **Interactions:** Iron can interact with other nutrients, such as calcium, zinc, and phosphorus, which could affect their absorption and efficacy. Multivitamins often aim to provide a harmonious balance of nutrients to minimize interactions.\n3. **Individual needs:** Iron requirements vary depending on factors like age, sex, diet, and health status. A one-size-fits-all approach wouldn't ensure that everyone gets the right amount of iron.\n4. **Separate supplementation:** Iron deficiency is a common issue, and it's often addressed with separate supplementation. This allows for more precise dosing and monitoring, especially in cases where iron deficiency is severe or accompanied by other health conditions.\n\n",

        "generated": "\n\nI'm happy to help you with your concerns about your baby's skin and marks.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that babies are born with a yellowish tint to their skin, which is due to the presence of bilirubin, a byproduct of the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin. This yellowish tint typically fades within the first few days of life as the baby's liver starts to process bilirubin more efficiently.\n\nRegarding your baby's skin darkening, it's common for babies to experience a slight increase in skin pigmentation in the first few months of life. This is usually due to the increased production of melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color. However, if you're concerned about your baby's skin darkening, it's always best to consult with your pediatrician to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nAs for the green marks on your baby's hips, back, hands, and legs, they may be caused by a few different factors:\n\n1. Mongolian spots: These are blue-gray patches that appear on the lower back, buttocks, and thighs of many babies, especially those of African, Asian, or Native American descent. They are benign and usually fade by the time the baby is 2-3 years old.\n2.",

It's not surprising that his doctor is recommending a transplant.\n\nNow, about the food question: cooked crawfish and sea bass can be safe to eat for someone with cirrhosis, but it's essential to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Protein content:** Both crawfish and sea bass are high-protein foods, which can be beneficial for people with cirrhosis. Protein helps maintain muscle mass, which is essential for overall health.\n2. **Fat content:** Crawfish tend to be relatively low in fat, making them a good choice. Sea bass, on the other hand, can vary in fat content depending on the cooking method and seasonings used. Opt for baked or grilled sea bass to reduce the fat content.\n3. **Allergies and sensitivities:** If your husband has any known allergies or sensitivities to shellfish (like crawfish) or fish, it's crucial to avoid them altogether.\n4. **Food handling and preparation:** Ensure that the crawfish and sea",

It's possible that you may be experiencing angina, which is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. However, since you mentioned that your blood pressure is low, it's also possible that the pain could be related to a vasospastic episode, where the blood vessels in your heart constrict, reducing blood flow.\n\nThe dizziness you experience when standing up, especially after gardening or low-lying activities, is likely due to orthostatic hypotension. This is a common condition where the blood pressure drops suddenly when you stand up, causing dizziness, lightheadedness, or even fainting. Since low blood pressure runs in your family, this is a plausible explanation.\n\nThe irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) you mentioned is also concerning. It's possible that it could be related to an underlying heart condition, such as atrial fibrillation, or it could be a side effect of a medication you're taking.\n\nGiven your symptoms, I would recommend the following:\n\n1.

Continue the Augmentin as prescribed by your doctor, but monitor your daughter's stool frequency and consistency closely.\n2.

A tear in this area can occur due to trauma, such as hyperextension, like in your case. The tear can cause pain, stiffness, and limited mobility, especially in bending the knee backward.\n\n**Treatment and management:**\n\n1. **Rest and ice:** Give your knee a break and avoid activities that aggravate the injury. Apply ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times a day, to reduce pain and inflammation.\n2. **Stretching and strengthening exercises:** Gentle exercises can help improve flexibility and strengthen the surrounding muscles. Focus on exercises that target the hamstring, quadriceps, and calf muscles. You can start with isometric exercises and progress to dynamic stretches as your symptoms improve.\n3. **Physical therapy:** Consider consulting a physical therapist who specializes in knee injuries. They can help you develop a customized exercise program to improve your range of motion, strength, and proprioception (balance and coordination).\n4. **",

It may be due to traumatic injection given to you during treatment. It can cause injury at the injection site leading to lesion formation and pain. Other reason can be that in case of deeply infected tooth if the filling is done accidentally directly over the tooth nerves and blood vessels present in the central portion of tooth can cause inflammation of pulp and pus formation near the root tips of tooth causing lesion formation and pain. One reason can be that during treatment any instrument got accidentally injured the gums or the filling material got impacted into the gums causing infection. Treatment can be decided only after clinical examination by a dentist to rule out the cause for infection. By the time you can take painkiller like Ibuprofen if u have pain and not allergic. If the cause is due to filling over the nerves' removal of filling followed by root canal treatment and antibiotics can resolve the lesion. If infection is ruled out antibiotics can be helpful.

        "generated": "\n\nBased on your symptoms, I'd like to consider a few possibilities.\n\nFirstly, the fact that the pain improves with ice and worsens with activity suggests that it's likely related to inflammation. The lump or swelling you're experiencing could be a sign of a soft tissue injury, such as a bruise or a hematoma.\n\nGiven your history of similar episodes and your lactose intolerance, gout is a possibility. Gout is a type of arthritis that can cause sudden, severe joint pain, typically affecting the big toe. However, it can also affect other joints, including the feet.\n\nThe connection between lactose intolerance and gout is that some research suggests that people who are lactose intolerant may be more likely to develop gout due to the increased levels of uric acid in their blood. Uric acid is a waste product that's produced when the body breaks down purines, which are found in many foods, including those high in protein and sugar.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that gout can also be caused by other factors, such as genetics, diet, and certain medical conditions.\n\nTo help diagnose the cause of your pain, I would recommend the following:\n\n1.

This could be due to the light emphysema signs on your CT scan. However, this would typically be accompanied by other symptoms like shortness of breath during exercise, which you don't experience.\n2. **Cardiovascular factors**: Your pulse oximeter readings suggest that your oxygen saturation levels drop at rest, but improve with exercise. This could be related to cardiovascular factors, such as:\n\t* **Coronary microvascular dysfunction**: This is a condition where the small blood vessels in the heart are not functioning properly, leading to reduced oxygen delivery to the heart muscle.\n\t* **Mitral valve disease**: Mitral valve regurgitation or stenosis could cause decreased oxygen delivery to the body, especially at rest.\n\t* **Pulmonary hypertension**: High blood pressure in the lungs can lead to reduced oxygen delivery to the body, especially at rest.\n3. **Respiratory factors**:",

Since you mentioned it feels like you're touching the base of your lower wisdom tooth, it's likely that the hole is located near the gumline, possibly due to gum recession or a small defect in the gum tissue.\n\nAs for whether it will heal by itself, it depends on the severity and cause of the hole. If the hole is small and shallow, it may be able to heal on its own over time. However, if the hole is deeper or more extensive, it may require professional treatment to promote healing and prevent further complications.\n\nIn general, gum tissue has a natural ability to regenerate and heal, but it may take some time. You can try to promote healing by:\n\n1. Maintaining good oral hygiene: Brush and floss regularly to remove plaque and bacteria that can exacerbate the condition.\n2.

The use of Peg-Interferon alpha-2b and filgrastim (G-CSF) during treatment can also contribute to this issue.\n\nGiven your current TLC count of 2500 and neutrophil percentage of 55%, it's essential to monitor your platelet count regularly to ensure it doesn't worsen or lead to bleeding complications.\n\nTo improve your platelet count, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Dietary changes:**\n\t* Increase your consumption of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, sardines, and flaxseeds. These omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties that may help improve platelet function.\n\t* Include foods high in antioxidants, such as berries, leafy greens, and other fruits and vegetables, which may help reduce oxidative stress",
