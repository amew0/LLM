While homeopathic treatment may be used in conjunction with conventional medicine, it is unlikely to be a standalone cure for heart disease.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, as described, suggest that they have a significant reduction in heart function (25%) and are experiencing issues with heart rate and blood pressure regulation. This is a serious condition that requires careful management and monitoring by a qualified healthcare professional.\n\nHomeopathic treatment may be used to manage some of the symptoms associated with heart disease, such as anxiety, stress, and sleep disturbances.

However, the fact that his blood test still shows he's infected is a concern.\n\nTyphoid fever is caused by Salmonella Typhi, which can be transmitted to your baby during pregnancy. It's essential to ensure your husband is fully treated and cleared of the infection before attempting to conceive.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that men with typhoid fever should be treated for at least 7-10 days with antibiotics before attempting to conceive. In your husband's case, he was treated for only 3 days, so it's likely that the infection is not fully cleared.\n\nI would recommend waiting for at least 7-10 days after the completion of antibiotics and ensuring that his blood test shows he's no longer infected before attempting to conceive. This will help minimize the risk of transmitting the infection to your baby.\n\nAdditionally, it's crucial to ensure that your husband completes the full course of antibiotics and follows up with his doctor to confirm that the infection has been cleared. You can also discuss with your doctor about the possibility of a follow-up",

Avoid smoke-filled areas: Try to stay away from areas where people are smoking, such as bars, clubs, or restaurants. If you must be in a smoke-filled area, wear a mask to filter out the smoke.\n2. Use air purifiers: Consider using air purifiers at home or in your car to remove smoke particles and other allergens from the air.\n3.

Based on your description, it's possible that the bump on your knee could be a type of soft tissue injury, such as a hematoma or a ganglion cyst.\n\nA hematoma is a collection of blood that has accumulated in the soft tissues, such as the skin, muscle, or fat, due to a trauma or injury.

Ganglion cysts are often caused by repetitive motion or trauma, and they can appear as a lump or bump on the skin.\n\nGiven that the bump is mostly squishy with hard parts and doesn't hurt unless you put pressure on it, it's possible that it could be a combination of both a hematoma and a ganglion cyst.\n\nSince you've been putting ice on it, that's a good approach to help reduce the swelling and pain.

Here are a few potential causes and some recommendations for you:\n\n1. Dry socket: A dry socket is a common complication after wisdom teeth extraction, where the blood clot that forms in the socket breaks down and exposes the bone. This can cause discomfort, pain, and a sensation of a lump or void in the socket. Since you mentioned the lump can be moved a bit, it's possible that this could be a dry socket.\n2. Bone spicule: Another possibility is that the lump is a bone spicule, which is a small piece of bone that can become exposed after extraction. Bone spicules can be painful and may cause discomfort or pain in the surrounding area.\n\nTo alleviate the symptoms and potentially get rid of the lump, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Gently rinse your mouth with saltwater: Mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt with 8 ounces of warm water and swish it around your mouth for 30 seconds before spitting it out. This can help reduce inflammation and promote healing.\n2. Use a warm saltwater rinse: Repeat the saltwater rinse 2-3 times a day for the next",

Hemoglobin is an essential protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to different parts of the body. A level of 8.9 is considered anemia, which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath.\n\nThe medication suggested, Renerv Plus, is likely an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). ESAs work by stimulating the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow, which can help increase hemoglobin levels. In your mother's case, the goal is to increase her hemoglobin level to above 8.5.\n\nThe treatment plan involves injecting Renerv Plus every alternate day for 5 doses. This is a common dosing regimen for ESAs, which are typically administered subcutaneously (under the skin) or intravenously.\n\nThe benefits of this treatment plan can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Increased hemoglobin levels**: Renerv Plus will likely help increase your mother's hemoglobin levels",

Typically, women are advised to start birth control pills within seven days of their last menstrual period because it is unlikely that she would've already ovulated at that time.  If you start the pill later in your cycle, the process initiates ovulation may have already begun and your body may produce an egg that is capable of being fertilized that cycle. However, even if you ovulated right when you started to take the pill, it is unlikely that the egg would still be viable to be fertilized after seven days.  Therefore, waiting seven days before having unprotected intercourse most likely was enough time to ensure that you would not become pregnant. Modern pregnancy tests will become positive within 10 days to two weeks after conception, so if you do not have a menstrual period at the end of your pill pack, you should perform a urine pregnancy test to be safe. However, if you start your pill later than one week after the start of your period, you may not actually bleed the first month during the pill free week.

The symptoms you're describing are quite concerning, and I'd like to help you investigate the possible causes.\n\nThe short, intense shooting pain in your left arm and left side of your head, lasting only a second, is a classic description of a type of headache known as trigeminal neuralgia (TN). TN is a chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from the face, including the forehead, cheek, and jaw, as well as the arm and head.\n\nThe increased frequency of these episodes over the past few months is also a concerning sign. I'd like to explore a few potential causes:\n\n1. **Trigeminal neuralgia**: As mentioned, TN is a possibility. This condition is often caused by compression or irritation of the trigeminal nerve, which can occur due to various factors such as:\n\t* Compression by blood vessels, tumors, or cysts\n\t* Injury or trauma to the nerve\n\t* Inflammation or infection\n\t* Certain medical conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or diabetes\n2. **Migraine**: Migraines can also cause intense, shooting pain in the head and arm.

It will require assessment by a medical specialist and some investigations before an organic cause can either be diagnosed or ruled out. Saiph",

The mild pain underneath your right ribcage to the middle could be related to inflammation or irritation of the diaphragm, which is a common symptom of GERD.\n\nThe wheezing and coughing, especially at night, could be related to postnasal drip or bronchospasm, which is common in smokers. The fact that you experience these symptoms at night suggests that they might be triggered by lying down or allergens in your environment.\n\nNow, let's talk about the burning pain in your chest. This is a significant symptom, and I'm going to take it seriously. The fact that it occurred while you were drinking brandy and coke suggests that it might be related to esophageal irritation or inflammation. The burning sensation in your chest could be a sign of esophagitis, which is inflammation of the esophagus.\n\nGiven your symptoms, I'm going to consider a few possibilities:\n\n1.

However, I understand your concern that iron deficiency might be a contributing factor.\n\nHere are a few potential reasons why you might be experiencing irritable hands and feet at night:\n\n1. **Magnesium deficiency**: Magnesium is essential for muscle relaxation and can help alleviate cramping.

Pilates and yoga can be excellent tools to help alleviate your symptoms by strengthening your core, improving your posture, and reducing muscle tension.\n\nHere are some specific Pilates and yoga postures that may help:\n\n1. Pelvic Clock:\n\t* Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.\n\t* Engage your core muscles and slowly tilt your pelvis upwards and then downwards, repeating the motion several times.\n\t* This helps to release tension in the pelvic floor and surrounding muscles.\n2. Kegel Exercises:\n\t* Sit comfortably with your back straight and engage your pelvic floor muscles as if you're stopping the flow of urine.\n\t* Hold for 5-10 seconds and release. Repeat for 10-15 repetitions.\n\t* Kegel exercises can help strengthen the muscles that support the pelvis and reduce pain.\n3. Cat-Cow",

I'm happy to help you address these issues.\n\nFirstly, let's tackle the postnasal drip. Postnasal drip is often caused by excess mucus production, which can be triggered by sinus infections, allergies, or environmental factors. To alleviate this symptom, you can try the following:\n\n1. Use a neti pot or a saline rinse to clear out your nasal passages. This can help reduce excess mucus and promote drainage.\n2. Take a decongestant, such as pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine, to reduce nasal congestion.\n3. Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air, which can help thin out mucus and make it easier to expel.\n\nRegarding the bad breath, it's likely caused by the postnasal drip and the presence of bacteria in your mouth. Here are some suggestions to help you address this issue:\n\n1. Practice good oral hygiene: Brush your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste, and floss once a day to remove any food particles or debris.\n2.

However, please consult a qualified healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\nIt sounds like you're experiencing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with irregular periods and have been taking medication to regulate your hormones. The recent ultrasound (USG) didn't show any major follicles, which may indicate that the previous treatment wasn't effective.\n\nThe doctor's recommendation to take another three-month course of medication with Duloxetine (Dulute-L) and Ebexid is a reasonable approach to try to stimulate ovulation. However, you're also considering the option of ovulation induction drugs like Clomiphene citrate (Clomipine type).\n\nOvulation induction drugs can help stimulate ovulation by increasing the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Clomiphene citrate is a commonly used medication for ovulation induction, but it's essential to note that it may not work for everyone, especially those with PCOS.\n\nBefore making a decision, consider the following:\n\n1. **Discuss the risks and benefits**: Talk to your doctor about the potential risks and benefits of ovulation induction",

Based on your description, I'd like to offer some insights and recommendations.\n\nThe pain you're experiencing on the left side of your chest, around 3 inches below the collarbone, is likely related to the muscles and soft tissues in that area. The fact that you can feel the pain when you press on the area suggests that it's likely related to muscle strain or tension.\n\nThe pain also being exacerbated by typing on the computer could be due to several factors:\n\n1. Repetitive strain injury: Prolonged typing can cause repetitive strain on the muscles and tendons in your neck, shoulder, and chest, leading to inflammation and pain.\n2. Poor posture: If you have a tendency to slouch or hunch over while typing, it can put strain on your muscles and joints, leading to pain and discomfort.\n3. Muscle imbalance: Weak or tight muscles in your neck, shoulder, or chest can cause poor posture and put additional stress on surrounding muscles, leading to pain.\n\nTo alleviate your symptoms, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Stretching exercises: Gentle stretching exercises can help relieve tension in the muscles and improve flexibility. Focus on exercises that target the muscles in your",

Since you had your gallbladder removed, it's understandable that you're wondering how this could be happening.\n\nThe cramping under your rib cage and back could be due to several factors, even though your gallbladder is no longer present. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Bile duct issues**: Although your gallbladder is gone, the bile ducts that were connected to it are still present. Sometimes, bile can still accumulate in the ducts, leading to cramping and discomfort. This could be due to a blockage, inflammation, or even a narrowing of the ducts.\n2. **Pancreatic or duodenal issues**: The pancreas and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) are nearby to the gallbladder and can also contribute to cramping and discomfort. Issues like pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or duodenal ulcers could be causing your symptoms.\n3. **Other digestive issues**: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroparesis, or other gastrointestinal conditions can also cause cramping and discomfort in the abdominal",

The treatment for plantar fasciitis involves stretching the calf area, applying ice, taking several medications such as ibuprofen.  Seeing a physical therapist can also help.  Bone spurs are very common and in themselves do not usually cause pain.  Most of the pain from plantar fasciitis comes from the soft tissues. Sometimes for severe plantar fasciitis I will prescribe a night splint. Surgery is almost never indicated for this condition. As regards the neck issue, it sounds as though this might be soft tissue in origin, particularly if your x-rays are negative.  You could be experiencing mild muscle spasm or a simple strain of the soft tissues in the cervical region.  It might be a good idea to pay a visit to a physical therapist who can teach you some stretches and some exercises to do at home. If your neck feels stiffer than simple applications of heat will help. I hope this information is useful for you. Please do not hesitate to message us back if you have any further questions.

Congratulations on your 1-year-old child!\n\nIt's not uncommon for women to experience changes in their skin after childbirth, including changes in oil production. There are several possible reasons for your oily skin, and I'll outline a few potential causes:\n\n1. **Hormonal changes**: After childbirth, your hormone levels may fluctuate, leading to an increase in sebum production. This is because the hormone prolactin, which helps with milk production, can also stimulate oil glands.\n2. **Stress**: Caring for a newborn can be stressful, and stress can trigger hormonal changes that affect your skin.\n3. **Sleep deprivation**: Lack of sleep can lead to increased stress hormones, which can contribute to oily skin.\n4. **Changes in diet**: Breastfeeding can lead to increased caloric intake, which may affect your skin.\n5. **Postpartum rebound**: Your skin may have adjusted to the hormonal changes during pregnancy, but after childbirth, your skin may \"rebound\" to its pre-pregnancy state, which could be oilier.\n\nAs for a permanent solution, I recommend trying the following:\n\n1. **Keep your skin clean**: Wash your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser, making sure to remove all",

Typhoid cancer is a rare type of cancer that occurs in the thyroid gland, and it's not directly related to typhoid fever, which is an infection caused by Salmonella Typhi.\n\nRegarding the diagnosis, the doctor has likely performed a physical examination, taken a medical history, and conducted imaging tests such as a thyroid scan or ultrasound to confirm the presence of cancer. A biopsy may also have been performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThe doctor's advice to operate is likely based on the following factors:\n\n1. The cancer is localized: The doctor has likely determined that the cancer is confined to the thyroid gland and has not spread to other parts of the body (metastasized).\n2. The cancer is resectable: The doctor believes that the cancer can be completely removed through surgery, which is the best chance for a cure.\n3.

It's often used in skincare products, including Mederma Stretch Mark Therapy, due to its moisturizing and hydrating properties.\n\nRegarding the potential effects of hyaluronic acid on your baby, it's essential to note that the amount of HA in Mederma Stretch Mark Therapy is unlikely to pose a significant risk to your pregnancy.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to consult your healthcare provider or a trusted medical professional for personalized advice. Here are some general points to consider:\n\n1. Absorption: HA is not absorbed through the skin in significant amounts, so it's unlikely to cross the placenta and reach your baby. The majority of HA is excreted through the kidneys and eliminated from the body.\n2. Concentration: The concentration of HA in Mederma Stretch Mark Therapy is relatively low compared to other skincare products. This reduces the potential for any adverse effects on your baby.\n3. Prolonged use: While the risk is low, it's essential to note that prolonged use of HA-containing products during pregnancy may lead to accumulation of the substance in your body.

If they worsen or show signs of infection (such as increased redness, swelling, or pus), seek medical attention.\n2. **Apply cold compress**: Gently apply a cold compress or an ice pack wrapped in a cloth to the affected area for 15-20 minutes, 2-3 times a day. This can help reduce swelling and alleviate pain.\n3. **Elevate the affected area**: When your daughter is sitting or lying down, encourage her to elevate her upper body to reduce swelling.\n4. **Monitor for respiratory distress**: Although rare, it's essential to monitor your daughter for any signs of respiratory distress, such as difficulty breathing",

It is important to know the exact area of cancer involvement. Cancer in esophagus happens due to the growth extending in to the lumen and then proliferating to cause obstruction to ingested foods. Surgery cannot be done at this stage and therefore radiation therapy has been recommended by her doctors. To increase passage of flow through the cancer area, you can discuss with your doctors if she can be given monitored doses of radiation followed by inserting a metallic stent to cause improvement in swallowing.

Some of these options include:\n\n1. Palliative care: This type of care focuses on relieving symptoms, such as pain, nausea, and difficulty swallowing, rather than curing the cancer. Palliative care can be provided alongside other treatments or as a standalone approach.\n2. Targeted therapy: This type of treatment targets specific molecules or pathways that are driving the growth and progression of the cancer. Examples of targeted therapies for esophageal cancer include erlotinib (Tarceva) and gefitinib (Iressa).\n3. Immunotherapy: This type of treatment uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer.

Cosmelite contains hydroquinone, a skin-lightening agent that helps reduce melanin production. When you stop using it, your skin may return to its natural pigmentation. This is because the melanocytes (skin cells responsible for melanin production) may start producing melanin again.\n2. **Darkening of skin in winters:** Winters can cause skin to appear darker due to the following reasons:\n\t* Reduced sunlight: With less sunlight, your skin may not produce as much vitamin D, which can contribute to a darker appearance.\n\t* Dry air: Cold weather can dry out your skin, leading to a dull, darker complexion.\n\t* Increased melanin production: As your skin tries to adapt to the cold weather, it may produce more melanin to protect itself from the sun's weaker rays.\n\nTo address your concerns, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Continue using Cosmelite:** If",

Absence seizures are characterized by a sudden, brief loss of consciousness, often accompanied by a blank stare, and can last anywhere from a few seconds to a minute.

Solman Omega-3: Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, have anti-inflammatory properties and may help lower triglycerides and blood pressure.\n\n**Pros and Cons of the Combination:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Amlodipine can help lower blood pressure, and Omega-3 may complement its effects.\n* Omega-3 may help reduce triglycerides and inflammation, which can be beneficial for cardiovascular health.\n\nCons:\n\n* Amlodipine can cause peripheral edema (swelling) and may interact with Omega-3, potentially increasing the risk of bleeding.\n* Omega-3 may interfere with the absorption of amlodipine, potentially reducing its effectiveness.\n\n**Alternative Combination Suggestions:**\n\nConsider consulting your doctor or a pharmacist to explore alternative combinations that might be more suitable for you.

The symptoms you've described, including recurring red rashes with small scabs, are consistent with scrub typhus. The fact that the rashes appeared on multiple areas of your body, including the scalp, arms, hands, wrists, and chest, is also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe timing of the onset of symptoms, shortly after your return from Myanmar, is also suspicious for scrub typhus. Myanmar is an endemic area for scrub typhus, and it's possible that you were exposed to the bacteria during your trip.\n\nRegarding the Keratoacanthoma, it's unlikely that it was the eschar (the characteristic rash that occurs in scrub typhus). The eschar is typically a raised, inflamed, and often painful lesion that forms at the site of the tick bite, whereas the Keratoacanthoma is a benign tumor that is not typically associated with scrub typhus.\n\nThe fact that the creams prescribed by your doctor have not alleviated your symptoms suggests that the rash may not be caused by a fungal or bacterial infection",

This elevation may be related to your previous Piles treatment or the Typhoid infection. However, it's essential to monitor your liver enzymes closely to rule out any underlying liver damage or disease.\n\n**Previous Piles Treatment**: You mentioned that you had Piles and received Siddha treatment, which seems to have resolved the issue.

Gross hematuria can be seen with our eyes as red urine. There is another type called microscopic hematuria where red cells are seen under the microscope. If red cells or red cells casts are present in the urine along with protein in the urine it means there is a kidney problem especially in a structure called glomerulus. Red cells or Frank blood in the urine may occur more commonly due to stones. It may also be seen with certain infections. Above the age of 40, we also try to rule out the possibility of kidney or bladder cancer. Certain medicines and certain food items may color the urine red but in this case the urine report is negative for blood or red cells. A condition called hemoglobinuria where the muscles are affected may cause red urine. The first step therefore is to read the urine report.

A complete blood count, CRP, sputum for microscopic examination and culture, chest X-ray pa view may be done. Your doctor will decide whether any further investigation will be needed depending upon the clinical findings. For any further questions please write back to us. Regards.",

Since you've had a head cold and productive cough for three weeks, it's possible that the underlying infection or inflammation might be causing some secondary symptoms.\n\nThe development of back pain on the left side, which you suspect might be related to a muscle strain, is an interesting observation. There are a few potential connections to consider:\n\n1. **Referred pain**: Sometimes, respiratory infections can cause referred pain in other parts of the body, including the back. This is because the nerves that supply the respiratory system can also innervate other areas, such as the thoracic spine. It's possible that the inflammation or infection in your chest or lungs is causing referred pain in your left side.\n2. **Musculoskeletal strain**: As you mentioned, it's possible that you may have pulled a muscle in your back, which could be unrelated to your respiratory infection. However, it's also possible that the coughing and strain from the infection could have contributed to the muscle strain.\n3. **Postural changes**: Coughing and congestion can cause postural changes, such as leaning forward or adopting a slouched position, which may put strain on your back muscles, leading to pain",

Keep in mind that I'm just an AI, and a thorough medical evaluation would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis.\n\nHere are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Musculoskeletal strain**: It's possible that you've developed a strain or sprain in your back muscles or ligaments, which is causing the pain. This could be due to overuse, poor posture, or a sudden movement that put extra stress on your back.\n2. **Spondylolisthesis**: This is a condition where a vertebra in",

However, I understand your concerns about the pain and discomfort you're experiencing.\n\nConsidering your medical history of diabetes with fluctuating sugar levels, it's crucial to discuss the surgical plan with your endocrinologist to ensure that your sugar levels are well-controlled before and during the procedure.\n\nFor a 18mm stone stuck in the duct, the most common surgical options are:\n\n1. Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL): This is a minimally invasive procedure where a small incision is made in the back, and a nephroscope is inserted to break down and remove the stone. This procedure is usually done under general anesthesia.\n2. Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS): This is a minimally invasive procedure where a ureteroscope is inserted through the urethra to access the stone, and then a laser or other instruments are used to break down and remove the stone.

To feel the heartbeat, you would place your hand on the front of the chest, specifically on the left side, about an inch and a half (3.8 cm) below the nipple line. This is because the heart is located in the thoracic cavity, and the left side of the chest is where the heart is positioned. The technical term for this area is the precordium.\n2. The heart is not as big as your fist. On average, an adult human heart weighs around 250-300 grams (8.8-10.6 oz) and is approximately the size of a fist, but it's not as wide or long as a typical adult fist.\n3. The heart beats around 100,000 times per day, which is approximately 3 billion beats per year. For a 22-year-old, that would be around 2.5 billion beats in their lifetime.\n4.

Since your dentist didn't find any decay or infection, mucositis could be a possible culprit.\n2. **Gingivitis**: Although your dentist didn't find any decay, it's possible that you have gingivitis, which is a mild form of gum disease. Gingivitis can cause inflammation and blisters on the gum tissue. However, since your dentist took x-rays and didn't find any signs of decay or infection, this might not be the primary cause.\n3. **Trauma**: Trauma to the gum tissue can cause blisters and inflammation. This could be due to a recent dental procedure, a blow to the mouth, or even a habit like biting or chewing on the affected side.\n4. **Referred pain**: It's possible that the pain and blisters you're experiencing are referred pain",

        "expected": "Hi.thanks for your query. You need to know about the causes of dark lips to be taking precautions better. A lot of people have it genetically predetermined, although parents may/may not have it. A frequent cause of non-genetic lip darkening is the use of lipsticks /colored balms/gloss, as these tend to darken the lips over a period of time. So try and not use it too often. If you have to use it, then let it be alleged free and replace them every 2 months. I would advise you to start using medicated lip balms with SPF and to reapply it several times in a day.that helps in reducing further darkening. Definite cream or any others having Comic acid can be used twice a day for lightening of lip color. It usually does not have side effects. However u can check for tolerance of the product by applying it for a short time on the first application. If you have a genetic tendency to dark lips, the pigmentation has chances of coming back after the cream is stopped. U can also opt for mild chemical peels once in 15-30 days to exfoliate better and lighten faster. Take care!",
        "generated": "\n\nI'm happy to help you with your concerns!\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that lip color can change over time due to various factors, including hormonal fluctuations, environmental exposure, and personal habits.\n\nBiting or licking your lips can indeed contribute to darkening of the lip color. When you bite your lips, you can cause micro-tearing of the skin, leading to the production of melanin, which can result in a darker appearance. Similarly, licking your lips can introduce bacteria and other substances that can cause inflammation and hyperpigmentation.\n\nRegarding the Depiwhite Advanced Depigmentation Cream, it is a topical treatment designed to reduce hyperpigmentation and dark spots on the skin. In your case, it might be effective in lightening your lip color, but it's crucial to note that the results may vary depending on the severity of the darkening and individual skin responses.\n\nHowever, it's essential to be aware of the potential side effects of using this cream on your lips. Some common side effects of depigmentation creams include:\n\n1. Skin irritation: Redness, itching, or burning sensations on the treated area.\n2. Dryness: The cream may dry out your lips, especially if you already have dry or chapped lips.\n3. F",

This can lead to abscesses, cellulitis, and other complications.\n4. **Cysts and tumors**: Impacted wisdom teeth can form cysts or tumors around them, which can damage surrounding bone and tissue.\n\nRegarding potential side effects, wisdom teeth extraction is generally a safe procedure when performed by a qualified dentist or oral surgeon.

First, let me acknowledge that it's great that you're taking proactive steps to ensure your twins receive proper nutrition. Nestle Nan Pro 1 is a good option for formula-fed infants.\n\nRegarding the diarrhea, it's essential to address it promptly to prevent dehydration and other complications. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Continue feeding with Nestle Nan Pro 1**: Despite the diarrhea, it's crucial to maintain a consistent feeding schedule to ensure your twins receive adequate nutrition. You can continue feeding them with the same formula, but you may need to adjust the frequency and volume of feeding.\n2. **Monitor their hydration**: Keep a close eye on your twins' urine output, and make sure they're producing a sufficient amount of pale yellow urine. If their urine output decreases or becomes darker yellow, it may indicate dehydration.\n3. **Offer breast milk or formula in small, frequent feeds**: Divide their usual feeding volume into smaller, more frequent feeds to help manage the diarrhea. This can help reduce the risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\n4. **Add an oral rehydration solution (ORS)**: You can mix an ORS, such",

Even though it needs clinical assessment for a diagnosis, from your history, it seems that you have inflammation/calculi in your gall bladder/biliary system giving rise to such intermittent severe pain. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to avoid fatty/oily food which would precipitate the pain more due to contraction of the gall bladder to empty bile into the intestines.  I would advise you a bland diet, some routine investigations like a CBC, a blood sugar, liver function test, a serum amylase and lipase to rule out associated pancreatitis, and an ultrasound abdomen to see the status of the biliary tree including the gall bladder to exclude a stone causing cholecystitis and also to know the status of the pancreas. Further management would depend on the result of clinical examination and reports of the related investigations. Till then, you could go for an anti-spasmodic along with a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

So the changing of your due date by four days does not really change the possibility of your first partner having been the father of your baby. Furthermore, sperm can remain alive in your genital tract for up to five days, and once you ovulate, the egg remains alive inside you for up to 72 hours. This is the reason that no test can accurately assess the date of conception based on the exact dates that you had intercourse.  Women typically ovulate two weeks before their period arrives.  If you have a 28-day cycle, and your last period started on June 4, you likely ovulated around June 18.

However, I must correct some misconceptions and provide a more accurate analysis.\n\nFirstly, the timing of your pregnancy is not consistent with your calculations. Your due date was initially estimated to be March 7th, 2015, but was later changed to March 11th, 2015. This change in due date is likely due to the fact that the ultrasound measurement of the embryo's crown-rump length (CRL) was not accurate, rather than the embryo growing faster than expected.\n\nSecondly, the concept of \"conceiving\" between a specific date range is not accurate. Conception occurs when a sperm fertilizes an egg, which can happen at any time during a woman's fertile window. The fertile window is typically 5-7 days around ovulation, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact time of conception.\n\nGiven the information you provided, it's possible that the father is the first guy you had sex with on June 4th, as you had sex with him multiple times after that date.

Antibiotics are a must to be taken in this case as it will fight infection and reduce the pus and swelling. So if you are allergic to a number of antibiotics, then first you should go for a blood test to rule out the safe antibiotics for you and then your Dentist can prescribe the same to you as taking antibiotics is a must for reducing infection. Once the infection becomes less than the tooth can be treated with root canal treatment or extraction can be done depending upon the condition of the tooth. You also need to take anti-inflammatory painkillers like Advil or Alive and serratiopeptidases. Do cool compresses over the swelling and do warm saline gargles. Hope this helps. Regards.",
        "generated": "\n\nI'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this distressing experience, Anne. I'm here to help you explore alternative options.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your concerns about the antibiotics not reaching inside the abscess are partially correct. Antibiotics are primarily effective against bacterial infections that are spread throughout the bloodstream. However, in cases of localized infections like abscesses, antibiotics may not penetrate the affected area effectively.\n\nGiven your severe allergic reactions to most antibiotics, it's crucial to avoid them and explore alternative approaches. Since you've already tried antibiotics and reacted badly, it's best to avoid them altogether.\n\nConsidering your creatinine level of 85 and blood pressure of 100/60, you don't have any significant kidney or cardiovascular concerns that would impact the treatment of your abscess.\n\nFor your abscess, I recommend the following options:\n\n1. **Warm compresses**: Apply a warm, damp washcloth to the affected area for 10-15 minutes, 3-4 times a day. This can help reduce swelling and promote drainage.\n2. **Drainage**: Your dentist or a healthcare professional can perform a minor surgical procedure to drain the abscess. This may be the most effective way to treat the infection.\n3.",

The pain can be exacerbated by pressure or movement, which would explain why it's so severe when you apply pressure to the area.\n2. **Liver or spleen injury**: Although it's less likely, it's possible that you suffered a bruise or injury to your liver or spleen during the fall. This could be causing the pain and tenderness in your right side.\n3. **Diaphragmatic injury**: The diaphragm is a muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. It's",

I would advise you to repeat the ultrasonography to see whether the stone has passed into the bladder or not. If it is passed into the bladder, nothing to worry as this will easily pass from the bladder out of the body.

Mild hydronephrosis means that the kidney is slightly swollen due to the blockage caused by the stone.\n\nGiven the size of the stone (6mm) and the fact that you have been taking plenty of fluids, there is a good chance that the stone may pass through on its own.

Drinking plenty of fluids: Continue to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water per day to help flush out the stone.\n2. Increasing urine output: Try to urinate frequently, especially during the night, to help move the stone along.\n3. Avoiding certain foods: Some foods, such as those high in oxalate, calcium, or sodium, can increase the risk of stone formation or make it harder for the stone to pass. Avoiding these foods may help.\n\nHowever, if you experience any of the following symptoms, you should seek medical attention:\n\n* Severe pain in your side or back\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Fever above ",

It can lead to pain radiating to jaw, throat, ear,eye and head. In this condition consultation with a dentist and getting an x-ray done is needed.

Since you've had a fracture in the same arm three years ago, it's possible that the pain you're experiencing now is related to the previous injury.\n\nWhen you fracture a bone, the surrounding soft tissues, such as muscles, tendons, and ligaments, can become weakened or damaged. This can lead to chronic pain, stiffness, or limited range of motion in the affected area. In your case, lifting more weight than usual may have put additional stress on the already weakened tissues, causing the pain to return.\n\nIt's essential to consult with your primary care physician or an orthopedic specialist to assess the situation. They will likely perform a physical examination, review your medical history, and may order imaging tests such as X-rays or an MRI to evaluate the bone and surrounding tissues.\n\nBased on the diagnosis, your doctor may recommend the following:\n\n1. Rest and avoidance of heavy lifting: Give your arm a break and avoid activities that aggravate the pain. This will help reduce the stress on the affected area and allow the tissues to heal.\n2.

That's a great sign of a healthy reproductive system.\n\nNow, regarding your concerns about getting pregnant after two medical abortions and taking Letrozole (letrozole is a medication used to induce ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other ovulation disorders), I'd like to provide some reassurance.\n\nTwo medical abortions, in themselves, should not significantly impact your chances of getting pregnant in the future. The procedure is generally considered safe, and the risk of infertility is low.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider a few factors that might affect your fertility:\n\n1. **Age**: As you're 28, you're still within a relatively good reproductive window. However, your chances of getting pregnant do decrease slightly with each passing year.\n2. **Letrozole**: Letrozole is a medication that can help induce ovulation, but it may not be necessary for you if you're having regular periods. If your doctor prescribed it, it's likely to help with ovulation, but it's essential to follow their guidance and monitoring.\n3. **Recovery",

It's great that you're already giving him ambroxol, which is a common medication for cough and congestion in infants.\n\nRegarding cotrimoxazole (also known as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or Septra), it is not typically recommended as a first-line treatment for a cough in infants under 6 months old. However, in some cases, it may be prescribed by a pediatrician for certain types of infections, such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis.\n\nBefore considering cotrimoxazole, it's essential to determine the underlying cause of your son's cough. Since he's only 10 months old, it's possible that his cough is related to a viral infection, which would not be treated with antibiotics like cotrimoxazole.\n\nAs for compatibility with ambroxol, it's generally recommended to avoid using antibiotics like cotrimoxazole with expectorants like ambroxol, especially in infants. This is because antibiotics can alter the gut flora, which may affect the absorption and efficacy of the expectorant.\n\nGiven your son's symptoms, I would recommend the following:\n\n1.

While it's possible for scoliosis to develop at any age, it's more common in children and adolescents, especially during periods of rapid growth.\n\nThe patient's history of meningococcal septicaemia at the age of 18 is an interesting factor. Although the infection itself is not a direct cause of scoliosis, it's possible that the inflammation and trauma caused by the infection could have contributed to the development of scoliosis.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the timing of the lumbar puncture procedure is unlikely to be directly related to the development of idiopathic scoliosis. The procedure itself is generally safe and well-tolerated, and the risk of scoliosis developing as a result of the procedure is extremely low.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of back and chest pain for the past year are concerning, and it's possible that the scoliosis could be contributing to these symptoms.

They can assess your specific risk factors and provide personalized guidance.\n\nAs a general rule, it's recommended that women who have had a recent mammogram or other imaging test wait for at least 24-48 hours before trying to conceive. This allows for any potential effects of the radiation to dissipate.\n\nIn your case, since you've had a mammogram and ultrasound today, you may want to wait for a day or two before trying to conceive. But it's not necessary to wait an entire month.\n\nIf you do become pregnant, it's essential to inform your healthcare provider about your recent imaging tests, including the mammogram",

It's possible that the bacteria may have developed resistance to this class of antibiotics, which could explain why your symptoms didn't improve.\n\nAs for the concern about being untreated while on holiday abroad, it's crucial to prioritize your health and seek medical attention as soon as possible. Delaying treatment can lead to worsening symptoms, increased risk of complications, and potentially life-threatening consequences.\n\nRegarding the lab report suggesting Imipenem, it's a carbapenem antibiotic that is often used to treat multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections, including Klebsiella pneumoniae. If your doctor is trying other antibiotics, it's likely because they're exploring alternative options or waiting for the results of the",

So ideally, prednisone should not be given in acute infection like pneumonia. Prednisone can cause skin rashes as a side effect. So possibility of prednisone induced skin rash is more in your case. Certain antibiotics can also cause skin rashes. Better to consult dermatologist and discuss all these and if possible stop prednisone. Hope I have solved your query.

It's essential to wait for a certain period after an abortion before trying to conceive again. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends waiting for at least 6 weeks after a first-trimester abortion and 12 weeks after a second-trimester abortion before trying to conceive again.\n\nRegarding your irregular bleeding, it's not uncommon to experience bleeding or spotting after an abortion. The dark brown blood clots you mentioned are concerning, and it's possible that they could be a sign of an underlying issue. I would recommend discussing this with your gynecologist to rule out any potential complications.\n\nSince you've had unprotected sex for the past 3 months and haven't conceived, it's possible that there might be an underlying issue affecting your fertility.

Sudden onset involuntary gasp without any respiratory symptoms (cough, breathlessness, chest pain) is commonly due to stress and anxiety. But if you are smoker or having above-mentioned symptoms then better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out lung related causes. If you are asymptomatic and nonsmoker then no need to worry. Stress and tension can cause sudden involuntary gasps. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query.

It sounds like you're experiencing occasional episodes of sudden shortness of breath, which can be concerning.\n\nGiven the context of your symptoms, it's possible that your episodes might be related to anxiety or stress. When you're feeling anxious or stressed, your body's \"fight or flight\" response can cause your heart rate and breathing to increase, leading to feelings of shortness of breath.\n\nHere are a few potential explanations:\n\n1. **Anxiety or stress:** As mentioned, anxiety or stress can cause rapid breathing, which might lead to feelings of shortness of breath.\n2. **Hyperventilation:** When you're feeling anxious or stressed, you might take rapid, shallow breaths, which can lead to hyperventilation. This can cause a buildup of carbon dioxide in your blood, leading to feelings of shortness of breath.\n3. **Panic attack:** It's possible that you're experiencing occasional panic attacks, which can cause sudden, intense feelings of fear or anxiety, accompanied by physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat, sweating, and shortness of breath.\n4. **Other medical conditions:** Although less likely, it's possible that your symptoms could be related",

Gentle stretching can help alleviate muscle spasms and tightness. Focus on stretching your hamstrings, calves, and glutes. You can also try gentle pelvic tilts, knee to chest stretches, and hamstring stretches.\n2. **Heat or cold therapy**: Apply heat or cold packs to the affected areas to help reduce muscle spasms and pain. Heat therapy, such as a warm bath or shower, can help relax muscles, while cold therapy, such as an ice pack or cold compress, can help reduce inflammation.\n3. **Pain management**: Consider taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) as directed. However, always consult with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any new medications, especially if you're already taking prednisone.\n4. **Glute strengthening exercises**: Since your right glute is tightening and",

While running the heart rate detector may mistake your body vibrations and movements for heart beats and count them accordingly. Hence the heart rate may erroneously show a high reading. So you have to check whether it happens to you only or with everyone. Another thing that can be done is a treadmill test. It requires you to run on a treadmill, the speed of which increases gradually to a point till your heart rate reaches a target rate. This TMT test will continuously record your EKG while you are running so all aberrations and errors can be rules out. It will definitely show whether you really have a fast heart rate on exercising. If it documents very fast heart rate further work up can be done. Wishing you good health. Thank you",

This is often referred to as a \"spike\" in heart rate, which can occur due to various factors, such as:\n\n1. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity: This is a normal response to exercise, which stimulates your heart to beat faster to meet the increased oxygen demands of your muscles.\n2. Increased cardiac output: As you exercise, your heart needs to pump more blood to deliver oxygen and nutrients to your muscles, which can cause a temporary increase in heart rate.\n3. Respiratory factors: The increased respiratory rate and depth during exercise can also contribute to a temporary increase in heart rate.\n\nThe fact that your heart rate drops quickly after exercise, without any symptoms or discomfort, suggests that your body is adapting well to the demands of exercise.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to monitor your heart rate and overall physical condition, especially as you continue to increase your exercise intensity and duration.

The symptoms you're experiencing, such as dizziness, nausea, and unbalanced walking, are common after a concussion.\n\nThe fact that you're experiencing these symptoms after eating suggests that you may be experiencing postprandial (after eating) dizziness, which is a common symptom of a concussion. The ringing in your left ear, although brief, could also be related to the concussion.\n\nAs for your upcoming procedure, it's essential to discuss your symptoms with your doctor or the anesthesiologist before undergoing liposuction and fat transfer. A concussion can increase the risk of complications during anesthesia and surgery.\n\nI would recommend the following:\n\n1. Consult with your doctor or an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist to evaluate your symptoms and assess the severity of your concussion.\n2. Provide your doctor with a detailed account of your symptoms, including the timing and severity of your symptoms, and any medications you're taking.\n3. Discuss your plans for the liposuction and fat transfer procedure with your doctor or anesthesiologist. They may recommend postponing the procedure until your symptoms have resolved or taking additional precautions",

It's great that you've been able to control your symptoms with medication and lifestyle changes.\n\nHowever, it's not uncommon for people with asthma to experience increased symptoms, especially during periods of stress, allergies, or respiratory infections. It's possible that your recent illness may have triggered your asthma symptoms.\n\nRegarding your question about whether asthma is curable, the answer is that it is not curable in the classical sense. Asthma is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management and treatment to control symptoms and prevent attacks.\n\nThat being said, with proper treatment and lifestyle changes, it is possible to manage your asthma and reduce the frequency and severity of attacks.\n\nAs for the best medicine to use, it depends on your specific needs and the severity of your symptoms. Here are some general recommendations:\n\n1. Quick-relief medications: If you're experiencing frequent asthma attacks, your doctor may recommend using quick-relief medications such as albuterol (Ventolin) or levalbuterol (Xopenex) to help relieve symptoms.\n2.

That being said, based on your description, I'll do my best to provide some insights and recommendations.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that Ixempra chemotherapy can cause gastrointestinal toxicity, including changes in bowel habits, diarrhea, and bleeding. The symptoms you're experiencing, such as blood in the stool, mucous, and bloody stools, are concerning and require further evaluation.\n\nThe presence of blood in the stool, especially with mucous, could be indicative of gastrointestinal damage or inflammation. The fact that you're experiencing bloody stools, which resemble menstrual bleeding, suggests that there might be some irritation or damage to the lining of the intestine, as you suspected.\n\nGiven your history of chemotherapy and the recent changes in your bowel habits, it's possible that the Ixempra chemotherapy is causing some degree of gastrointestinal toxicity. The low fiber diet you've started might help alleviate some symptoms, but it's crucial to discuss this further with your oncologist.\n\nI would recommend the following:\n\n1. Schedule an appointment with your oncologist as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms and any concerns you may have.\n2",

Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your blood to clot, and a low count can increase your risk of bleeding.\n\nThe fact that you've had two tests with low platelet counts suggests that it's not just a one-off anomaly. Your doctor is likely concerned about the underlying cause of your low platelet count and wants to monitor your situation to rule out any potential complications.\n\nAs for your symptoms of fatigue and dizziness, they could be related to your low platelet count, but it's also possible that they're related to your panic attacks. Panic attacks can cause physical symptoms like dizziness, lightheadedness, and fatigue, especially if you're experiencing them frequently.\n\nRegarding the two-month wait for further testing, it's likely that your doctor is trying to balance the need to monitor your situation with the need to avoid unnecessary testing or interventions.

As a doctor, I'll provide you with the most accurate information possible.\n\nPre-cum, also known as pre-ejaculate or pre-ejaculatory fluid, is a clear or whitish fluid that is released from the penis before ejaculation. While it's often referred to as \"pre-cum,\" it's not actually a type of semen.\n\nThe composition of pre-cum is still somewhat debated among scientists, but it's generally believed to be a mixture of:\n\n1. Prostatic fluid: This comes from the prostate gland and contains enzymes that help break down semen.\n2. Cowper's gland fluid: This comes from the Cowper's gland, located at the base of the penis, and contains a combination of water, mucins (a type of protein), and electrolytes.\n3. Other substances: Pre-cum may also contain small amounts of other substances, such as urea, creatinine, and amino acids.\n\nNow, regarding the possibility of sperm being present in pre-cum: it's unlikely but not impossible.\n\nSperm can be present in pre-cum in certain situations, such as:\n\n1. Retrograde ejaculation: This is a condition where semen is released into the bladder instead of the urethra. In",

Bleeding from the penis after first sex:\nIt's rare for bleeding to occur during or after first-time sex, especially if proper hygiene and lubrication are used.

However, the readings you mentioned, particularly the low blood pressure readings, do warrant some attention.\n\nThe normal blood pressure range is typically considered to be 90-120 mmHg systolic and 60-80 mmHg diastolic. Your readings, especially the 88/58 mmHg, are significantly lower than normal.\n\nThere are several potential reasons for your low blood pressure, including:\n\n1. Medication: Your blood pressure medication, 25mg pills, might be contributing to the low readings. It's possible that the dose is too high or that your body is responding to the medication in an unusual way.\n2. Dehydration: As the weather is gloomy, it's possible that you're not getting enough fluids, leading to dehydration. Dehydration can cause blood pressure to drop.\n3. Anemia: As a menopausal woman, you might be experiencing anemia due to hormonal changes. Anemia can cause low blood pressure.\n4. Blood loss: If you've experienced any bleeding or blood loss recently, it could be contributing to your low blood pressure.\n",

Cause in your case-As the lump is of 2 1/2 weeks duration after review of your query data, it seems to be due to either of the following reasons--Post-traumatic Hematoma with traumatic swelling-which is in process of recovery and may take another 2-3 weeks.-If it doesn't settle after 4-6 weeks, Pre-Patellar Bursitis(Housemaids Knee)-post-traumatic needs to be ruled out. Both above possibilities needs to be ruled as only discomfort is felt by you while walking. In the absence of more information, I would advise Second opinion in your case, who would examine it and investigate it to treat it as per the cause of the lump.

It can cause a burning sensation on the left side of the chest, which can radiate to the arm and wake you up at night. This condition is more common in women and can be triggered by stress, fatigue, and other factors.\n2. Precordial catch syndrome: This is a benign condition that causes chest pain, usually on one side, which can be sharp or burning in nature. It's often triggered by stress, anxiety, or fatigue, and can be exacerbated by heavy lifting or bending.\n3. Angina: While it's unlikely that you're experiencing a heart attack, it's possible that you're experiencing angina, which is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. This can be triggered by physical activity, stress, or other factors.\n",

Sometimes due to fall there are chances that you may damage the soft tissue of the lumbar spine and also the bony alignments are disturbed. The reason for this is the whole load is borne by the lumbar spine as there is a tremendous thrust on the hip region due to fall.

A contusion is a type of soft tissue injury that occurs when blood vessels are damaged, causing bleeding into the surrounding tissue. In your case, the contusion may have occurred in a deeper layer of tissue, which could explain why there's no visible bruise.\n\nRegarding the pain, it's great that you're experiencing some relief with the 600mg ibuprofen every 4 hours. The sharp pain you're experiencing when sitting down or standing up could be due to the muscle spasms or inflammation in the affected area. This is a common phenomenon in soft tissue injuries like contusions.\n\nAs for how long the pain will take to go away, it's difficult to predict exactly. However, with proper treatment and management, you can expect the pain to gradually subside over the next few weeks. It's possible that the pain may take 2-3 weeks to resolve, but this can vary depending on the severity of the injury and your overall recovery.\n\nIn addition to taking ibuprofen, using an ice pack every few hours can help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain.

As your doctor, I'll do my best to address your questions and provide guidance.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you've had a previous successful IUI cycle in 2015. However, it's not uncommon for fertility outcomes to vary between cycles.\n\nRegarding your current situation, your age and weight could potentially impact your fertility. As you approach 31, your ovarian reserve (the number and quality of eggs you have) may start to decline. This natural decline can make it more challenging to conceive.\n\nBeing overweight, particularly with a BMI of 35 (235 lbs at 5'8\"), can also affect your fertility. Excess weight can lead to:\n\n1. Hormonal imbalances: High levels of estrogen and insulin resistance can disrupt ovulation and make it harder to conceive.\n2. Insulin resistance: This can lead to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-like symptoms, which can affect ovulation and fertility.\n3. Increased inflammation: Excess weight can cause chronic inflammation, which may affect egg quality and embryo development.\n\nConsidering your history of successful IUI in the past, it's possible that your current fertility challenges are related to your age and weight.

A fibrotic shadow on your lungs, as seen on a chest X-ray, is a common finding in people with TB. Fibrosis refers to the scarring or thickening of lung tissue, which can occur as a result of the infection.\n\nThe good news is that TB is treatable with antibiotics, and the goal of treatment is to eliminate the bacteria from your body.

Since you're not currently sexually active, we can rule out sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as the primary cause. Here are some potential explanations:\n\n1. **Urethral granulation tissue**: After a urethoplasty, it's possible that granulation tissue can form at the site of the repair, leading to the appearance of a black, filament-like discharge. This is a common complication after urethral reconstruction and can be asymptomatic.\n2. **Diverticulum-related discharge**: Your bladder diverticulum could be contributing to the discharge. The diverticulum might be producing mucus or debris that's being expelled through the urethral opening, causing the black discharge. This could be related to the diverticulum's proximity to the urethral orifice.\n3. **Foreign body or debris**: Although you're not currently sexually active, it's possible that there's a foreign body or debris lodged in the urethral opening, causing the discharge. This could be a small piece of tissue, a fragment of the urethral repair material, or even a tiny stone.\n4. **Infection",

These effects are usually temporary and should subside once the dosage is adjusted or the medication is tapered off.

I'm happy to help you understand the potential benefits and timeline of using Clomid and Progynova.\n\nClomid (clomiphene citrate) is a common medication used to stimulate ovulation in women with ovulation disorders. By blocking estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, Clomid increases the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which in turn stimulates the growth of multiple follicles in the ovaries. This can increase the chances of ovulation and fertilization.\n\nProgynova (estradiol) is a hormone replacement therapy medication that helps regulate the menstrual cycle and ovulation. It's often used in combination with Clomid to help synchronize ovulation and improve fertility.\n\nThe combination of Clomid 50mg and Progynova 2mg can potentially increase your chances of conceiving by:\n\n1. Stimulating ovulation: Clomid can help induce ovulation in women with ovulation disorders, increasing the chances of releasing a mature egg.\n2.

You see anxiety is an ailment which can be overcome very easily. Try relaxation techniques like consciously breathing in and out twice a day for 5 minutes. It will help you to relax. Every night before going to sleep write out 3 things that went well that day, it can be anything like you read a good story book, or you helped someone in the street, cooked a delicious dish just anything.

        "generated": "\n\nI understand your concerns and would like to address them.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're aware of your body and took the initiative to look up the swelling. Swollen lymph nodes in the inguinal area can be caused by various factors, including infection, inflammation, or even hormonal changes.\n\nRegarding the spotting, it's possible that it could be related to the swelling, especially if you're experiencing stress and anxiety. Stress can cause hormonal imbalances, which may lead to spotting or irregular bleeding. Additionally, your diet and lack of nutrients may also contribute to hormonal imbalances.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the spotting could also be a sign of a more serious issue, especially given your history of sexual activity and being on birth control. While you're using triple protection, it's still possible that there could be an underlying issue that needs attention.\n\nAs for the swelling growing overnight, it's not uncommon for lymph nodes to swell rapidly in response to an infection or inflammation. However, in your case, the fact that you've had the swelling for a week suggests that it may be related to a more chronic issue.\n\nGiven your concerns, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician or a gynecologist to get a proper evaluation.

You're right that it's associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer, although the overall risk is still relatively low. Additionally, it's recommended to discontinue Progynova during pregnancy due to the potential risks to the fetus.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that your doctor has likely prescribed Progynova as part of a comprehensive treatment plan to help regulate your menstrual cycle and prepare your body for pregnancy. CCQ50 and Duphaston are also commonly used medications for ovulation induction and fertility treatment.\n\nBefore making any changes to your medication, I would recommend discussing your concerns with your doctor. They can assess your individual situation and provide personalized guidance.\n\nHere are a few questions to consider asking your doctor:\n\n1. What are the specific reasons for prescribing Progynova, and are there alternative medications that could be used instead?\n2. How can you minimize the risk of breast cancer associated with Progynova, and what monitoring measures can be taken?\n",

Here's why:\n\n1. **Blocked fallopian tube:** With a blocked tube, natural conception is unlikely. IVF bypasses the fallopian tubes and allows for fertilization to occur outside the body.\n2. **Polypoid endometrium:** Although the polyps are not causing any immediate issues, they might impact the success of natural conception or IUI (Intrauterine Insemination).

I would recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician or a dermatologist to have the lump examined.\n\nDuring the examination, your healthcare provider will likely ask you some questions about the lump, such as:\n\n* When did you first notice the lump?\n* How long have you had the lump?\n* Is the lump painful or tender to the touch?\n* Is the lump movable or fixed in place?\n* Have you experienced any trauma or injury to the area recently?\n\nThey may also perform a physical examination to assess the lump, including feeling its size, shape, and consistency. They may also take a medical history and perform a physical examination to look for any other signs of injury or illness.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to provide some additional information to help your healthcare provider make a more informed assessment.

        "generated": "\n\nA great question!\n\nFirstly, I'm glad you're seeking medical attention, and it's excellent that you're concerned about the lump.\n\nThe lump you're describing is likely a common complication of a fractured ankle, especially one that's been healing for a significant amount of time. The most likely cause of this lump is heterotopic ossification (HO), also known as bone spurs or calcification.\n\nHeterotopic ossification is a condition where bone tissue forms outside of the normal bone structure, often as a result of trauma, surgery, or inflammation. In your case, the fracture and subsequent healing process may have led to the formation of excess bone tissue, which is causing the lump.\n\nCalcification deposits are a possible cause, but it's not the most likely explanation in this scenario. Calcification typically occurs when calcium salts accumulate in soft tissues, such as tendons, ligaments, or muscles. While it's possible that calcification could be contributing to the lump, the fact that it's growing in size over time suggests that HO is a more likely cause.\n\nNow, regarding potential problems:\n\n* HO can cause pain, stiffness, and limited mobility in the affected joint. In your case, the lump may be compressing surrounding soft tissues, leading to",

However, cancer can often present with non-specific symptoms, making it challenging to diagnose solely through blood tests.\n\nIn the case of testicular cancer, the symptoms are often subtle, and it's crucial to perform a physical examination to detect any abnormalities.

A doctor can perform a testicular examination to check for any lumps, swelling, or changes in the testicles.\n\nIf you're concerned about having cancer, I would strongly encourage you to schedule an appointment with your doctor.

The pain is usually a result of compression or irritation of the surrounding muscles, ligaments, and nerves.\n\nHowever, there are some possible mechanisms by which a thoracic bulging disk could potentially cause shortness of breath:\n\n1. **Referred pain**: The pain from the bulging disk can radiate to the chest, which may be perceived as shortness of breath. This is because the nerves that supply the chest wall also supply the upper back, and the brain can interpret the pain as coming from the chest.\n2. **Respiratory muscle involvement**: The thoracic spine and surrounding muscles play a crucial role in respiration. A bulging disk can compress or irritate the respiratory muscles, leading to decreased lung function and shortness of breath.\n3. **Neurological involvement**: The nerves",

Yes, many women have undergone Hysterolaparoscopy to remove blockages in their fallopian tubes and have gone on to conceive naturally afterwards. While every individual's experience is unique, it's not uncommon for women to get pregnant after the procedure.\n\n2. If your blocked tube is removed during the laparoscopy, it's possible that you may be able to get pregnant naturally. However, it's essential to note that the success rate of natural conception after tubal reconstruction varies depending on several factors, including the severity of the blockage, the quality of the remaining tube, and the overall health of the woman.\n\n3. To minimize complications and ensure a smooth recovery, you should take the following precautions:\n\t* Follow your doctor's instructions regarding post-operative care, including pain management, wound care, and activity restrictions.\n\t* Avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities for 4-6 weeks after the procedure.\n\t* Take your prescribed medications as directed and follow up with your doctor for regular check-ups.\n\t* Avoid sexual intercourse for 4-6 weeks after the procedure to minimize the risk of complications.\n\n4.

The symptoms you experienced, such as feeling cold and clammy, nausea, vomiting, and fever, are consistent with a vasovagal reaction, which is a common reaction to certain medical procedures.\n\nVasovagal reactions occur when the body's autonomic nervous system is stimulated, causing a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate. This can lead to symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nIn your case, it's possible that the spinal MRI procedure caused a vasovagal reaction, which led to your symptoms. The fact that you were able to complete the brain MRI last week without any issues suggests that the reaction may be specific to the spinal MRI procedure.\n\nIt's a good idea to follow up with your doctor to discuss your symptoms and determine the best course of action.

However, the recent changes in his kidney function tests (KFTs) are concerning.\n\nThe creatinine level of 1.54 mg/dL is slightly elevated, indicating mild kidney dysfunction. The normal range for creatinine is 0.4-1.4 mg/dL. A creatinine level above 1.4 mg/dL can indicate kidney damage or reduced kidney function.\n\nThe BUN (blood urea nitrogen) level of 12 mg/dL is also elevated, but not as significantly as the creatinine level. A BUN level above 20 mg/dL can indicate kidney damage or reduced kidney function.\n\nGiven that your father's urine analysis is normal, with no proteinuria (protein in the urine) or hematuria (blood in the urine), it's unlikely that the elevated creatinine and BUN levels are due to acute kidney injury or glomerulonephritis.\n\nHowever, there are several possible explanations for these changes:\n\n1. **Chronic kidney disease (CKD",

In cases like yours with an ankle sprain and then continued pain, it is most likely that there was some soft tissue damage on the structures that support the ankle joint itself. There is a ligament and two tendons on the outside of the ankle that are the main stabilizers, and these structures can get stretched, partially torn, or completely torn with a sprain. Most times, these will scar back down and continue to support the ankle. Other times, they will not be able to do the job as they did before and will have to work \\\"overtime\\\" to do the same job. This area then gets inflamed and painful, especially after a full day of trying to stabilize the joint (being on the feet all day). It is wise to start out with an ankle brace and see if that helps the area, as the brace can do the job of these soft tissue structures and give them a break to help decrease inflammation/pain.

Regular follow-up appointments and imaging studies can monitor the mass's size and progression.\n2. Steroids and antibiotics: As you mentioned, your doctor has already tried medication (methylprednisone and zithromax) to reduce the size of the mass. If the mass is caused by an allergic reaction or infection, these medications may be effective in reducing its size and alleviating symptoms.\n3. Endoscopic sinus surgery: This minimally invasive procedure uses a thin tube with a camera and instruments to remove the mass through the nasal passages.

It works by suppressing the pituitary gland's production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn reduces the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This can help stimulate ovulation and increase the chances of pregnancy.\n\nSince you took the tablet at 2 weeks of pregnancy, it's possible that it may have affected your pregnancy. However, it's crucial to note that the effects of Triptorelin on a developing fetus are not well-studied, and more research is needed to fully understand its potential risks.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that Triptorelin is not recommended for use during pregnancy, as it may cause fetal harm.

It's available over-the-counter and has been shown to be effective in promoting weight loss. However, it may cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as diarrhea, and should be used with a low-fat diet.\n2. Phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia): This medication is a combination of an appetite suppressant and an anticonvulsant. It's FDA-approved for weight loss and has been shown to be effective in promoting weight loss, especially in individuals with a BMI of 30 or higher. However, it may cause dizziness, insomnia, and constipation.\n",

This can cause irritation and discomfort in the urethra and surrounding areas.\n\nThe pain or discomfort you're experiencing now, which feels like it's located at the point where you usually feel the need to urinate, is likely due to the irritation and inflammation caused by the sperm and urine mixture in the urethra. This is a common phenomenon, especially when there's a delay between urination and ejaculation.\n\nThe fact that urinating helps alleviate the discomfort suggests that the issue is indeed related to the urethra and the buildup of urine and sperm.\n\nAs for the potential harm caused by mixing sperm and urine, it's generally not a significant concern. However, it's possible that the sperm may have been damaged or altered by the acidic environment in your urine, which could potentially affect fertility. However, this is highly unlikely and would require further evaluation.\n\nThe cranberry capsules you're taking may help alleviate any potential bacterial infections,",

While it's likely that your sedentary winter has contributed to your fatigue, high blood pressure can also be a culprit.

A hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL is below the normal range for adults (13.5-17.5 g/dL for men and 12-16 g/dL for women).\n\nGiven your history of heart surgery and vasculitis, it's possible that your anemia is related to these conditions. Vasculitis can cause inflammation and damage to blood vessels, which can lead to anemia.\n\nThe fact that your hemoglobin level was 13.5 g/dL previously and has decreased to 11.6 g/dL suggests that your anemia may be worsening over time. This could be due to ongoing inflammation or damage to your blood vessels.\n\nKidney problems could also be contributing to your anemia. The kidneys produce erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Kidney disease or dysfunction can lead to decreased erythropoietin production, resulting in anemia.\n\nYour thyroid hormone replacement medication, levothyroxine, is unlikely to be causing your anemia,",

Here are a few possible explanations for your bloated stomach:\n\n1. **Fluid retention**: After surgery, your body may retain more fluid due to inflammation, swelling, or changes in your circulation. This can lead to temporary weight gain and bloating. As your body heals, the fluid retention usually subsides, and your stomach shape returns to normal.\n2. **Muscle relaxation**: During the surgery, your abdominal muscles may have been temporarily relaxed or weakened. As you recover, these muscles may take time to regain their tone, which can cause a temporary bloating or swelling.\n3. **Post-operative constipation**: Laminectomy surgery can cause temporary changes in bowel habits, leading to constipation. This can cause bloating, discomfort, and abdominal distension.\n4. **Changes in body composition**: After surgery, your body may redistribute fat or water, which can affect the appearance of your stomach.\n\nGiven your history of having a relatively flat stomach and hips that protrude, it's unlikely that you're just getting fat.

The warm and red appearance of your upper arms is likely due to a phenomenon called \"vasodilation.\"\n\nVasodilation occurs when the blood vessels in your arms dilate (widen) due to the surgical procedure. This can cause an increase in blood flow to the area, leading to warmth and redness. It's usually a benign and temporary condition that resolves on its own within a few days.\n\nSince you're not experiencing any pain or tenderness, it's unlikely to be a cause for concern. However, it's always a good idea to report any unusual symptoms to your surgeon or healthcare provider, especially if you have any concerns.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few things you can do to alleviate the symptoms:\n\n1. Keep your arms cool: Try to keep your upper arms away from direct sunlight or heat sources. You can also use a cool compress or a cold pack wrapped in a towel to reduce the warmth.\n2.

This could be due to a variety of factors, including:\n\n1. Bile duct obstruction: Although no stones were detected, it's possible that there's a temporary or partial obstruction of the bile ducts, leading to inflammation and swelling of the gallbladder.\n2. Bile acid dysregulation: Your bland diet might be contributing to an imbalance of bile acids, which could lead to gallbladder inflammation.\n3.

But I will try to explain you something. It is quite known in cardiology that stent stenosis might happen. This risk is higher during the first 6 months and then decreases. But there are other possibilities after a stent re-stenosis like angioplasty with balloon, stent-intra stent implantation that mean that you might implant a stent into the obstructed stent, always depending on the type of your first stent and the characteristic of the stenosis. And the last option when the other are not possible is by-pass surgery that you all ready know. So, yes...if your three arteries have problems and your stents get stenosis you might end to bypass surgery. If this is technically possible or not depends on the characteristics of your coronary arteries and the positions of stenosis. The risk of bypass surgery depends on your age, your heart function and other organs functions. But you should not worry. You do have possibilities to go quite well. There are a lot of possibilities today with a good chronic medical treatment, angioplasty and by pas' surgery. Wish I was helpful. Best regards.",

This may include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine-2 (H2) blockers, or antacids. These medications can help reduce the frequency and severity of acid reflux episodes.\n2. **Asthma management**: Continue taking your ashthalin inhaler as prescribed by your doctor.

        "expected": "Hello, Sorry to hear about the list of injuries you faced. Coming to the point, you mentioned that MRI is suggestive of Lumbar and cervical disc degenerative changes. Let's discuss this first and then the rest. What my experience taught me over a period of 12 years with cases related to injuries like you and others I will give my suggestion. First foremost, buy a soft neck collar and start using it. This will stabilize the bones of the cervical region and also will act as s support to the muscular system to allow less compression over the nerve. The disc injuries are most times self-healing, once the inflammation subsides you should not feel much pain. When using neck collar I will advise you to use on/off hot water fermentation so that the muscled which have undergone spasm will relax, and the pain will come down slowly. Along with this. You have lumbar disc degenerative changes, so why don't you first take hot water fermentation so that the muscles of the lumbar region gets relaxed and make you at least stable. Post this use 3-4 pillows and try McKenzie maneuver in passive way. The details of McKenzie you can find over the net. This will help centralize the pain and once the pain is centralized you can use hot water bag to again soothe the nerve roots. Once nerve root is relaxed the pain travelling in its course will reduce automatically. Post which after 5-7 days of doing this you can focus on exercises, but please continue the above advice as well. Exercise should focus on core stability, lower limb strengthening, upper limb strengthening and neck muscle strengthening. Slowly you will develop strength also and the inflammation on the nerve root will be reduced leading to the end result of improved lifestyle. If your pain symptoms are too high then a nerve block may be administered to the nerve root which may block the pain sensation for a couple of months. But if the muscles remain week still, it will again come back so doing the above-mentioned exercise will be of help to avoid recurrence of pain symptoms. Coming to the surgical management, there is possibility of removal of the torn disc element and also fusing the spine, but this may not make you get rid of the pain over all for long. The pain will be present throughout the life and need exercise for the same. This option I do not recommend unless and until the motor functions are compromised. Also, very important is the diet, what you eat is to be focused. Having food which can digest faster without leading to any gastritis should be kept in mind. As with gastritis there may be leading to two symptoms, one compression over the nerve in the lower spine and headache. Having a good diet plan will be good. Please do not ignore the hip and knee muscles as you have the replacement done in the past and the muscles are weak this may aggravate the spine curvature to deviate and lead to other symptoms. Coming to your ankle, I cannot comment much as the history is too brief to guide over anything. I am sorry for it. Please contact a local physical therapist who can show interest in you and give the maximum output. I have tried my best to put forth the best possible treatment plan which should help you. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.",

I'm a doctor, and I'll do my best to help you figure out what might be going on.\n\nBased on your description, I'm going to take a closer look at the symptoms you've experienced. You've mentioned numbness in your hands and legs when you sit or lie down, which could be related to compression or pressure on nerves. The sensation of numbness is often accompanied by tingling, prickling, or a \"pins-and-needles\" feeling.\n\nThe strange sensation you described, like \"jijijiji,\" is quite unique, and it's not a typical symptom I've seen before. It's possible that this could be related to nerve activity or abnormal electrical impulses in your nervous system.\n\nThe fact that numbness occurs when a specific part of your body is touched or stimulated is also intriguing. This could be related to a condition known as \"allodynia,\" where normally non-painful stimuli (like light touch or pressure) become painful or unpleasant.\n\nGiven that you've visited multiple doctors in different countries and haven't received a clear diagnosis, I'm going to take a more comprehensive approach to help you identify the underlying cause.\n\nTo better understand your symptoms, I'd like",

Hormonal imbalances: Hormonal imbalances, such as low testosterone, can also contribute to RE.\n\nTo address your concern, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Consult a doctor: It's essential to consult a doctor to determine the underlying cause of your RE.

There are various remedies, best is to use a broad spectrum sunscreen daily three times. At night one can use de-pigmenting creams only on the spot. These creams either contain HY Chat Doctor. One can even go for chemical peels from a dermatologist at regular intervals. The latest is the use of lasers, but the results are not very promising as compared to the cost involved.

Topical treatments: You can try over-the-counter (OTC) creams or gels containing ingredients like aloe vera, tea tree oil, or witch hazel. These may help soothe and calm your skin.\n2. Moisturize: Use a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer to help hydrate your skin and reduce dryness, which can exacerbate rosacea symptoms.\n3. Avoid triggers: Identify",

This can help minimize withdrawal symptoms and reduce the risk of rebound effects.\n3. Monitor your symptoms: Keep track of your symptoms and how they change as you taper off the medications. This can help you identify any patterns or triggers and make adjustments to your plan as needed.\n4. Consider alternative therapies: In addition to medication, there are other therapies that may be helpful in managing your symptoms, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR).\n5.

The diffuse increase in echo texture means that you have a bit of a fatty liver, which in itself can be normal due to aging. This can lead to NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatoses), which is a fancy way of saying you have fat that is damaging your liver.  This isn't necessarily reversible, but you can limit the amount of damage that is done to your liver by limiting your alcohol intake, and staying away from fatty foods.  Your hepatic ducts are within normal size, and the range can be anywhere from 2\\u00a0mm to 7\\u00a0mm, depending on your age and liver function. I wouldn't worry about this.  Your right kidney seems fine and again, no cause for concern.  Overall, you have hepatic stenosis which means fatty liver. Stay away from fatty foods, alcohol, and limit your Tylenol intake to no more than 2 grams per day (and only if you absolutely need it).  I'd also recommend you get a repeat liver ultrasound in 6 months to a year, as well as have your liver enzymes checked. I hope I have answered your questions.

        "generated": "\n\nBased on the ultrasound report, here's a summary of the changes:\n\n1. Liver: The liver's echo texture has increased diffusely, which means that the liver tissue is appearing more echogenic (brighter) on the ultrasound image. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as liver inflammation, scarring, or fatty liver disease. The fact that the liver's echo texture was previously described as moderate, but has now increased to a diffuse increase, suggests that the liver's echogenicity has worsened.\n2. Extra-hepatic common duct: The diameter of the extra-hepatic common duct has decreased from 5 mm to 3 mm. This is a significant decrease and could indicate that the duct is no longer obstructed or inflamed.\n\nThe only other measurement mentioned in the report is the right kidney, which measures 10.1 cm in length. This is not significantly different from the prior measurement, so it's likely that the kidney's size and shape are normal.\n\nIt's important to note that an ultrasound report is just a snapshot in time, and further evaluation may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of these changes. Your doctor may recommend additional tests, such as blood work or imaging studies, to investigate further.",

        "generated": "\n\nI'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nDicaris is an antihelmintic medication, commonly used to treat parasitic infections. Since you missed taking it on Monday and Thursday, it's essential to catch up on the missed doses.\n\nAccording to the standard dosage instructions, it's recommended to take Dicaris tablets once a week. Since you took it on Wednesday, you should take the next dose on Thursday, not today. Taking it today would be skipping a dose, which may not be ideal.\n\nIt's generally recommended to maintain the regular dosing schedule to ensure the medication is effective in treating the infection. Taking a two-day gap between doses is not necessary, but it's essential to follow the recommended dosing schedule.\n\nConsidering you have to take Betnosol (a topical corticosteroid) on Saturday and Sunday, it's better to take the missed dose of Dicaris on Thursday as scheduled. This will help maintain the regular dosing schedule and ensure the medication is effective in treating the infection.\n\nIf you have any concerns or questions, I recommend consulting your doctor or pharmacist for personalized advice. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and medical needs.\n\nRemember to take the next dose of Dicaris on Thursday as scheduled, and",

The lump could be a cyst that's been present for years, but the hormonal changes during your menstrual cycle are causing it to become more painful and swollen.\n2. **Hernia:** A hernia occurs when a weak spot in the abdominal wall allows a part of the intestine to bulge through. While hernias can occur in both men and women, they're more common in women, especially during pregnancy. The lump could be a hernia that's been present for years, and the hormonal changes during your menstrual cycle are causing it to become more painful.\n3. **Ovarian cyst:** Although you mentioned the lump is in your groin area, it's possible that the lump is actually related to your ovaries.

I'm happy to help you understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, let's put your mind at ease: an Sgot (also known as AST) level of 79 is not extremely high, and it's not necessarily a cause for concern. Sgot is an enzyme that's released into the bloodstream when the liver is damaged or stressed. Elevated levels can be seen in a variety of conditions, including liver disease, muscle damage, or even cardiac issues.\n\nGiven that your other liver enzymes are normal, and your cardiac work-up came back normal, it's unlikely that your elevated Sgot is related to liver disease or cardiac issues.\n\nNow, let's consider the fact that you've recently started exercising harder and eating less. This can cause a temporary increase in Sgot levels due to muscle damage or stress. It's possible that your increased physical activity has caused a minor increase in Sgot levels, which is reversible once your body adapts to the new exercise routine.\n\nTo better understand what's going on, I would recommend repeating the blood work in 2-3 months to see if your Sgot levels return to normal. In the meantime, you can continue with your exercise routine and healthy eating habits, as they",

I'm happy to help you understand the possible reason for your weight gain while taking Ibufren (800mg) in the UK.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to note that Ibufren is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which is commonly used to treat pain and inflammation. While it's generally well-tolerated, it can have some side effects, including changes in body weight.\n\nThere are a few possible reasons why you may have gained weight while taking Ibufren:\n\n1. Water retention: Ibufren can cause fluid retention, which can lead to weight gain. This is because it can increase the production of aldosterone, a hormone that regulates electrolyte balance and water retention.\n2. Increased appetite: Some people may experience increased appetite while taking Ibufren, which can contribute to weight gain.\n3. Metabolic changes: Ibufren can affect the body's metabolism, leading to changes in the way it processes carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. This can result in weight gain, particularly around the midsection.\n4. Hormonal changes: Ibufren can affect hormone levels, including insulin and cortisol, which can impact metabolism and weight.\n\nIt's also possible that the weight gain",

However, it's also important to note that a single chest X-ray may not always be sufficient to rule out potential lung problems.\n\nIn your case, since you've been experiencing a persistent cough for almost three weeks, it's reasonable to want to know what's going on. The fact that your doctor told you that everything is okay and you don't need another X-ray may not be entirely reassuring, especially if you're still experiencing symptoms.\n\nHere are a few possible reasons why your doctor might not have ordered another X-ray:\n\n1. The suspicious densities might have been due to a benign condition, such as a collapsed lung or a small amount of fluid in the lungs, which could resolve on its own.\n2. The doctor might have felt that the initial X-ray was sufficient to rule out more serious conditions, such as lung cancer or pneumonia.\n3. The doctor might have recommended further evaluation, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or a bronchoscopy, but decided that an additional X-ray was not necessary.\n\n",

In your friend's case, the PET scan may not have detected the tumor if it's small or located in the stomach or other areas that are not easily imaged by PET.\n2. **Tumor biology:** Some tumors may not be highly metabolically active, which makes them difficult to detect by PET scan. This could be the case if the tumor is a slow-growing, low-grade cancer.\n3. **Ascites fluid:** The malignant ascites fluid itself may be contributing to the lack of PET scan detection. The fluid can contain tumor cells, but they may not be metabolically active enough to be detected by PET.\n4. **False negatives:** PET scans are not 100%",

Here's a possible explanation:\n\nThe stabbing pain in your chest and back, along with the pain when turning your neck, could be due to a strain or sprain in the muscles or ligaments of your thoracic spine (mid-back) or the surrounding muscles. This region is prone to injury, especially when performing exercises that involve twisting or bending movements.\n\nThe exercise ball may have contributed to the strain by putting additional stress on your spine and surrounding muscles. When you lifted up during sit-ups, you may have inadvertently caused a sudden, sharp movement that put excessive force on your thoracic spine, leading to the pain.\n\nTo alleviate your symptoms, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Rest: Avoid any strenuous activities, including exercise, for the next 2-3 days to allow the affected area to heal.\n2. Stretching and foam rolling: Gentle stretching and foam rolling can help reduce muscle tension and promote relaxation. Focus on the muscles of your thoracic spine, as well as the surrounding areas, such as your neck and upper back.\n3. Heat or cold therapy: Apply heat or",

While the oral pills may have some effect, they are not 100% effective in preventing pregnancy.\n\nGiven the timing of your unprotected sex, it's possible that you may be pregnant.

But as you are young this might be due to faulty posture of sitting. This can be due to long time sitting in front of computer or table work. Correct your posture. Sit straight and avoid bending from back while doing work. Go for back extension exercises daily. Ok and take care.",
        "generated": "\n\nI'd be happy to help you understand the X-ray results and provide guidance on managing your lower back pain.\n\nThe X-ray report mentions that there is \"straightening of spine is seen with loss of normal curvature suggestive of muscle spasm.\" This means that the X-ray showed that the natural curvature of your spine (lordosis) in the lower back region is reduced or absent, which can be a sign of muscle spasm or tightness.\n\nThis finding is not uncommon, especially in young adults like yourself. Muscle spasm can cause the spine to straighten or lose its natural curvature, which can lead to discomfort, stiffness, and pain in the lower back.\n\nThe prescription of Cyclobenzaprine is a good starting point, as it is a muscle relaxant that can help relieve muscle spasms and reduce muscle tone. However, since you're still experiencing pain, we need to consider other factors that might be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nHere are some potential causes and suggestions to help you resolve your problem:\n\n1. **Muscle imbalances**: Muscle imbalances can occur when some muscles become overactive or tight, while others become weak or underactive. This can lead to poor posture, muscle strain, and pain. Consider incorporating exercises that target the core muscles,",

Given your history of gallbladder removal and previous endoscopy, it's unlikely that your symptoms are related to gallstones or a bile duct obstruction.\n\nThe fact that your symptoms subside after the gagging and vomiting subsides suggests that there may be a gastrointestinal component to your pain. The presence of a hernia repair with mesh in 2013 could potentially be contributing to your symptoms, especially if the mesh is causing irritation or inflammation in your abdominal cavity.\n\nThere are a few potential explanations for your symptoms:\n\n1. **Hernia mesh-related issues**: As mentioned earlier, the hernia repair with mesh could be causing irritation or inflammation in your abdominal cavity, leading to your symptoms. It's possible that the mesh is causing a foreign body reaction, which can lead to chronic pain and discomfort.\n2. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: The pattern of pain and gagging/vomiting could be related to GERD, especially if you have a hiatal hernia (which was repaired in 2013).

However, not getting pregnant despite regular periods can be frustrating and concerning.\n\nTo better understand the situation, I have a few questions:\n\n1. What was the underlying cause of her irregular periods that led to her seeking medical attention?\n2. Has she been tested for any underlying hormonal imbalances, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, or other hormonal issues?\n3. Have you both been trying to conceive for the past two years without any success?\n4. Are there any other factors that might be affecting her fertility, such as age, weight, or a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)?\n\nRegarding the frequency of intercourse, it's generally recommended to aim for at least 2-3 times a week, but ideally, every other day or every 36-48 hours, around the time of ovulation. This increases the chances of successful conception. However, I would like to emphasize that frequency alone is not the only factor that determines fertility.\n\nConsidering your wife's history of irregular periods and the fact that she's now in routine, I would recommend the following:\n\n",

Cradle cap is a common condition that affects babies and young children, typically between 2-12 months of age. However, it can occur in older children as well.\n\nCrusted seborrheic dermatitis is a type of eczema that causes a thick, yellowish, crusty buildup on the scalp. The crusty patches can be dry, flaky, or oily, and may be accompanied by redness, itching, and inflammation. In your son's case, the patches are attached to the scalp and feel like lumps, which is consistent with crusted seborrheic dermatitis.\n\nThe good news is that crusted seborrheic dermatitis is generally a benign condition and can be treated at home. Here are some tips to help your son:\n\n1. Gently remove the crusts: Use a fine-tooth comb or a soft-bristled brush to gently remove the crusts from your son's scalp.

Do not take a BP reading in an arm that is injured or has an IV or a shunt. Sit and rest for 5 minutes before you take your BP. Extend your arm and support it on a flat surface. Your arm should be at the same level as your heart. Both of your feet should be flat on the floor. The device has a built-in pump that inflates the cuff. Put the cuff about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above your elbow. Wrap the cuff snugly around your arm. The BP reading may not be correct if the cuff is too loose. Turn on the BP monitor and follow the directions. Write down your BP, the date, the time, and which arm you used to take the BP. If possible, take your blood pressure twice and write down both readings. These BP readings can be 1 minute apart. Let the air out of the cuff. Turn off the monitor and take off the BP cuff.

        "expected": "Hello.thanks for trusting the Chat Doctor doctors for your health related queries. I guess your concern is about...can u have safe pregnancy after an infection and hormonal imbalance post miscarriage.right.my answer is.YES.there are chances of safer pregnancy in the future. Usually after miscarriage it is routine that doctor will advise for ultrasound to conform that whether is miscarriage is COMPLETE (that means all products of conception are expelled out from the womb) or INCOMPLETE (there is retained product of conception inside the womb). In both the cases usually antibiotics are prescribed to prevent infection and incomplete miscarriage usually required minor surgery for removal of retained products so that chances of infection further decreases. As u told that u had miscarriage in last year, but u didn't give whether it was complete or incomplete. U had taken antibiotics or not. So it is difficult for me to comment on this. After miscarriage there is hormonal imbalance usually happens, but in most of the cases it will correct spontaneously. Some women required medication for correlation of it. This hormonal imbalance usually effects the menses, due to that menses will be irregular.u told that u have hormonal imbalance but didn't give info regarding your menses whether it is regular or irregular. So it is difficult for me to comment on this.u also told that u have taking separate which cause pain in your abs, for that u can take alternative medicine after discussing with your treating doctor. With the above information u can try out my suggestions-1. RELAX...DON'T WORRY. there are chances of safer pregnancy in your case. So KEEP PATIENCE.2. If your infection had resolved n u have regular menses then there is DOUBLE CHANCE of getting pregnant in your case.3. If u r in hurry then visit nearby infertility specialist. He/she can help u. I hope the above information is useful, informative and helpful for u.regards- Chat Doctor. .DON'T WORRY.everything will be alright. I pray the God that u will be blessed with a cute n healthy baby.hopefully TWINS)",

First, let me acknowledge that it's great that you're taking proactive steps to support your pregnancy after a previous miscarriage and hormonal imbalance.\n\nRegarding your question, Meprate (Mifepristone) is a medication commonly used to support pregnancy, particularly in cases of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. It's essential to note that Meprate is not a routine medication for supporting a healthy pregnancy. It's usually prescribed in specific situations, such as:\n\n1. Threatened miscarriage: To prevent the passage of the embryo through the cervix and to help the pregnancy continue.\n2. Ectopic pregnancy: To treat an ectopic pregnancy and prevent rupture.\n3. Molar pregnancy: To treat a molar pregnancy and prevent further complications.\n\nHowever, since you're experiencing abdominal pain after taking Meprate, it's crucial to discuss this with your doctor. Abdominal pain can be a symptom of various conditions, including:\n\n1. Uterine contractions: Meprate can cause uterine contractions, which might lead to abdominal pain.\n2. Ectopic pregnancy: If the Meprate is not working as intended, it could be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy,",

These products can help alleviate pain without the systemic side effects of oral medications.\n2. **Muscle relaxants**: Your doctor might consider muscle relaxants like cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) or carisoprodol (Soma) to help manage your muscle spasms and pain. However, be aware that these medications can have sedating effects and may interact with other medications.\n3. **Antidepressants**: Certain antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil) or duloxetine (Cymbalta), have been shown to have analgesic properties and might be effective in managing your fibromyalgia-related pain.\n4. **Botox injections**: Botox",

As a doctor, I'd like to help you explore possible connections between the unexplained bruises and your medical history.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that unexplained bruising can be caused by various factors, including trauma, bleeding disorders, or underlying medical conditions.\n\nGiven your history of severe anemia during pregnancy, it's possible that your daughter may be experiencing some residual effects. Anemia during pregnancy can lead to decreased platelet count, which can increase the risk of bruising and bleeding. However, it's unlikely that this would cause the specific pattern of bruising you've described, with new bruises appearing on both legs.\n\nThe development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) during your pregnancy could also be a contributing factor. DVT can lead to post-thrombotic syndrome, which may cause chronic venous insufficiency, pain, and swelling in the affected limb. Although this is more commonly associated with the affected limb, it's possible that the condition could cause bruising or discoloration on the opposite leg.\n\nOther potential causes of unexplained bruising in children include:\n\n1. Bleeding disorders: Von Willebrand disease, platelet disorders, or other inherited bleeding disorders could be responsible",

This could cause your daughter to experience discomfort, burping, and a sensation of something being stuck in her throat.\n2. **Swallowing difficulty**: The choking incident may have affected your daughter's swallowing mechanism, making it difficult for her to swallow food and liquids properly.

As the mucosal surfaces are irritated and inflamed due to infection, therefore there is burning sensation while eating or Chat Doctor. . So my suggestion is to consult an Emergency room and get a throat swab culture done. It will help in ruling out whether it is bacterial or viral throat infection. At times there is viral infection with secondary bacterial infection. In that case you will be advised antibiotics like Azithromycin, anti-inflammatory painkillers like Advil, Alive etc., do warm saline gargles, antiseptic mouthwash gargles and suck throat lozenges. You can also suck lozenges with numbing agents to reduce pain and burning. Hope this helps. Regards.",
        "generated": "\n\nBased on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have a viral pharyngitis, which is an inflammation of the throat caused by a virus. The burning sensation in your mouth when eating warm soup and the red areas and irritation in the back of your throat, roof of your mouth, and sides are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nAs for the possibility of strep throat, it's unlikely based on your symptoms. Strep throat typically presents with a sudden onset of severe sore throat, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. The presence of red areas and irritation in the back of your throat, roof of your mouth, and sides is more consistent with a viral pharyngitis.\n\nTo prevent the condition from getting worse, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, tea, and soup, to help soothe your throat and keep your mouth moist.\n2. Use a humidifier: Dry air can exacerbate throat irritation, so using a humidifier can help add moisture to the air and relieve discomfort.\n3. Avoid irritants: Avoid exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke, pollution, and strong odors, which can further irritate your throat.\n4. Gargle with salt water: Mix 1",

        "expected": "Hi Amino, thanks for asking from Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are suffering from Potts spine (TB of spine). You are already taking 4 first line anti-tubercular therapy, which is ideal treatment of Potts spine. The therapy is long, around 9 to 15 months. There is no standard treatment guidelines. The duration can be decided based on your physician decision and your symptoms. Now coming to your symptoms, leg cramps and sciatica. These symptoms are most probably due to compression and collapse of vertebrae, collection of pus in spinal canal and compression of nerves. To get relief, you should-Avoid any kind of weight-bearing- Avoid flexion and extension at spine-Wear back supporting belt like thoracolumbar corset.- For pain relief, you can take tablet pregabalin after proper prescription. Usual adult is 75 to 150 mg twice a day. If still no relief, you can take tablet amitriptyline after proper prescription.- For cramps, do physiotherapy and take tablet baclofen after proper prescription.- Also increase your protein and calcium intake for strengthening bones. If still no relief and symptoms worsen, repeat MRI spine to rule out any progressively increasing compression of spinal cord or nerves. Sometimes surgery (less than 10% cases) may be needed to relieve pressure symptoms. Hope it will help you. If still in doubt, do let me know. Thanks. Take care. Chat Doctor.",

Start taking the pill on the second day of your menstrual period, as recommended by your doctor.\n\n**Timing of taking Femilon:**\nTake the pill at the same time every day, preferably at the same time as your daily routine, such as with breakfast or dinner.\n\n**When to take Femilon after sex:**\nFemilon is a progestin-only pill, which means it does not contain estrogen. It works by thickening the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and also thinning the lining of the uterus, making it less likely for a fertilized egg to implant. Therefore, it's not necessary to take Femilon immediately after sex.\n\n**Other important information:**\n* It's essential to take Femilon consistently, at the same time every day, to maintain its effectiveness.\n* If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, but make sure you take the next dose at the usual time. If you miss two or more doses, consult your doctor for guidance",

This can put pressure on nearby nerves and cause pain, numbness, or weakness.\n* **Bulging disc**: A bulging disc occurs when the intervertebral disk protrudes or bulges outward, but does not necessarily tear or herniate. This can also put pressure on nearby nerves and cause symptoms.\n\n**What do your MRI results mean?**\n\nYour MRI shows:\n\n* 2 tears in the L5-S1 disc (previous surgery site)\n* Mild bulging in the L5-S1 disc\n* Herniation in the L4-L5",

After taking the medicines whether the menses have become regular or not, it is also not shared by you. It is natures rule, as we get older the functions of our body will be decreased quantitatively and qualitatively. The ovaries also decrease in its function as women become old. The reproductive age group, that is maximum chances of conceiving is more usually at 20 to 40 years.  Around the age of 50 to 52 years, women stop her menses. This indicates she can't conceive anymore. The age 45-48 years is a transition zone from highly reproductive age group to the age group where menses stop. And here the chances of getting pregnant are not as high as reproductive age group and not low as 50- 52 yrs of age. But still there are a chances of getting pregnant in this transition age, and you are at 42, so there is a hope of getting pregnant. Be positive and don't lose hope. However, irregular menses at this age decreases the chances of pregnancy. But, as you are on medicine for irregular menses, once the menses becomes regular, the chances of getting pregnancy increases. So there is double positive hope for you.

The high progesterone levels after ovulation are a good sign, indicating that the corpus luteum is functioning properly.\n\nThe unusual bleeding patterns you've experienced, including the light implant bleeding on day 24 and the short, light period on day 26, are not uncommon during early pregnancy. The bleeding can be a sign of implantation or a slight hormonal fluctuation.\n\nThe doctor's concern about your symptoms and the request to see you on day 16 after ovulation were likely due to the possibility of early pregnancy. The fact that you didn't have a regular period on day 26 and had light bleeding instead may have raised his suspicions.\n\nThe use of Duphaston (dydrogesterone) is a common treatment to support luteal phase progesterone production and help establish a healthy pregnancy. The medication is typically taken for 10-14 days, and the doctor wants to monitor your response to it. If you don't start having a regular period by day 7, it may indicate that the pregnancy is not progressing as",

I would recommend repeating the ultrasound or considering other imaging modalities such as a CT or MRI scan to rule out any ovarian pathology.\n3. **Endometriosis**: The fact that your symptoms are recurring and associated with a bulge in the lower right groin suggests that endometriosis may be a possibility.

The endometrium is shed during the periods in women of the reproductive age group. At your age, it is important to get an endometrial biopsy if your gynecologist has advised one. Hormonal changes can cause vaginal bleeding in elderly women but if you had a continuous bleeding for 5 to 7 days then it is a concern for endometrial polyp or cancer. Since no large polyp is seen, it can also be that the endometrium is altered due to many reasons. Early stages of cancer cannot be seen on ultrasound. I suggest you also get an MRI scan of your pelvis with the recommendation of your doctor and then do endometrial biopsy. If the biopsy results are negative for malignancy then benign causes must be thought of. If the bleeding repeats frequently then you might require a surgery.

A normal endometrial thickness is typically less than 4 mm. Your doctor's nurse reported an endometrial thickness of 8 mm, which is considered slightly thickened.\n\nWhile an 8 mm endometrial thickness does not necessarily mean you have endometrial cancer, it may indicate an increased risk.

However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and addressing any underlying health conditions may help reduce your risk. Here are some general suggestions:\n\n1. Maintain a healthy weight: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Aim for a healthy body mass index (BMI) through a balanced diet and regular exercise.\n2. Eat",

Loss of perception of smell is mostly due to viral infection. It is due to inflammatory changes in mucosa. No need to worry about this also. This will normalize by itself once your viral fever is treated completely. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Start with a lower concentration: If you're new to using Vitamin C serums, you might consider starting with a lower concentration (around 5-7%) and gradually increasing as your skin becomes more tolerant.\n2. Look for a more gentle formula: Some Vitamin C serums may be more gentle on the skin than others. You might consider looking for products that use a more gentle delivery system, such as a liposomal or encapsulated formula, which can help reduce irritation.\n3. Use a moisturizer: Applying a moisturizer after using the Vitamin C serum can help counteract the dryness and dullness.

It's great to hear that your GGT levels returned to normal after you reduced your drinking.\n\nAs a general guideline, the American Liver Foundation recommends that men limit their daily alcohol consumption to no more than 2 drinks per day, and women to no more than 1 drink per day. A \"standard\" drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of spirits (such as whiskey, vodka, or gin).\n\nConsidering your history of heavy drinking and your recent LFT results, it's reasonable to assume that your liver has been affected to some extent. While your GGT levels have returned to normal, it's essential to maintain a cautious approach to ensure your liver health.\n\nDrinking 2 shandies (approximately 1-2 standard drinks) per week is likely safe for you at this point. However, it's crucial to monitor your liver function tests regularly to ensure that your liver is not being re-damaged.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following guidelines to maintain your liver health:\n\n1.

It's commendable that you're seeking alternative treatments to manage your condition.\n\nRegarding your question, I must clarify that acupressure is not a recognized medical treatment for polio. Polio is a viral disease that can cause permanent damage to the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and other complications.\n\nWhile acupressure may provide some temporary relief from symptoms such as pain, stiffness, or muscle spasms, it is not a substitute for evidence-based medical treatments. The World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other reputable health organizations do not recommend acupressure as a treatment for polio.\n\nIn fact, the WHO recommends a multidisciplinary approach to managing polio, including physical therapy, orthotics, and rehabilitation to improve mobility and function. Additionally, antiviral medications and vaccines are available to prevent and treat polio.\n\nI would advise you to consult with a qualified healthcare professional, such as a neurologist or a rehabilitation specialist, to discuss your treatment options. They can help you develop a personalized plan to manage your",

I'll do my best to address your questions and provide guidance.\n\nEnterogermina is an over-the-counter medication used to treat diarrhea. It's generally considered safe and effective for children. However, I have some concerns based on your son's symptoms and history.\n\nVomiting is not a typical side effect of Enterogermina, and it's a sign that your son's body is trying to get rid of something. Given that he vomited once on Saturday and again last night, it's possible that the medication may not be agreeing with him.\n\nThe frequent trips to the bathroom between 5 and 11 pm last night, along with the loose stools, suggest that your son's diarrhea may not be fully resolved. It's also possible that the medication may not be effective in managing his symptoms.\n\nConsidering your son's normal weight and age, it's unlikely that he has a severe underlying condition. However, it's essential to monitor his symptoms and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.\n\nHere's what I recommend:\n\n1. Stop giving him the remaining dose of Enterogermina. It's possible that",

        "generated": "\n\nBased on your description, it sounds like you may be experiencing sensitivity in your top left canine tooth, particularly when you rub your finger across the front of the tooth or the gum surrounding it. The sensitivity is likely due to dentin hypersensitivity, which is a common condition that affects many people.\n\nDentin hypersensitivity occurs when the dentin, a layer of tissue beneath the enamel, is exposed due to worn enamel, gum recession, or cracks in the tooth. When the dentin is exposed, it can react to stimuli such as hot or cold temperatures, sweet or sour tastes, or pressure, causing pain or discomfort.\n\nThe fact that the sensitivity is triggered by rubbing your finger across the front of the tooth and the gum suggests that the dentin may be exposed in this area. The pain that radiates to the tooth when you rub the gum also suggests that the nerve endings in the dentin are being stimulated.\n\nThe fact that it doesn't hurt to push up on the tooth or put your teeth together is not uncommon, as these actions do not typically stimulate the dentin.\n\nTo alleviate the sensitivity, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Use a desensitizing toothpaste: There are many toothpastes available that are specifically designed to help reduce dentin",

Here's a possible scenario:\n\nThe tooth infection may not have been fully resolved with antibiotics alone, and bacteria may have spread to surrounding tissues, including the lymph nodes and soft tissues in the neck region. This could have led to the development of a abscess or a collection of pus, which can manifest as a tender, swollen knot or lump.\n\nThe sensitivity to touch is likely due to the inflammation and swelling in the affected area. It's also possible that the knot is a manifestation of a secondary infection, such as cellulitis or lymphangitis, which can occur when bacteria spread through the lymphatic system.\n\nI would recommend that you seek medical attention from a dentist or an oral surgeon to assess the situation further. They will likely perform a physical examination, take a medical history, and possibly order imaging studies (such as a CT or MRI scan) to determine the extent of the infection and its relationship to the original tooth.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to manage the symptoms with over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and apply warm compresses to the affected area to reduce swelling and ease",

Chest pains can be a concerning symptom, but in your case, it's likely related to the food you're consuming.\n\nWhen you eat foods high in sugar and salt, they can cause a rapid increase in blood pressure and blood sugar levels.

Is it always after eating sugary or salty foods?\n* How long do the pains last?\n* Are there any other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or lightheadedness?\n* Do you have a family history of heart disease or other medical conditions?\n\nYour doctor may also perform a physical examination, take your blood pressure, and order some tests to",

This bleeding can be caused by the embryo implanting itself into the uterine lining. It's possible that the bleeding you experienced was related to implantation, and the pregnancy test picked up on the hormone levels at that time.\n2. **HCG levels**: Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) is the hormone detected by pregnancy tests. The levels of hCG can fluctuate during early pregnancy. It's possible that the initial positive test result was due to a surge in hCG levels, while the subsequent negative tests were due to a dip in those levels.\n3. **Pregnancy test sensitivity**: Different pregnancy tests have varying levels of sensitivity.

You should know that the degree of Dementia is not only evaluated based on the MRI findings, but also based on the cognitive test results. Anyway, regarding the treatments, there are different treatment options, including Cholinesterase inhibitors (Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Gallant amine) or Meantime(which is an N -methyl-D-aspartate (MDA) antagonist). I would also recommend checking vitamin D, vitamin E and vitamin B12 plasma levels for possible deficiency and her thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction.

        "generated": "\n\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand the diagnosis and treatment options for your mother's dementia.\n\nFirstly, a moderate diagnosis of dementia on an MRI scan typically indicates that the brain changes associated with dementia are more advanced than those seen in mild cases, but not yet as severe as those seen in advanced cases. However, it's essential to note that the severity of dementia can vary widely between individuals, and the diagnosis is not solely based on the MRI results.\n\nRegarding the EEG test results, they are not typically used to diagnose dementia, but rather to evaluate other conditions such as seizures or encephalitis. Since the MRI results are already indicating moderate dementia, it's likely that the EEG results will not significantly impact the diagnosis or treatment plan.\n\nNow, regarding medications to slow the progression of dementia, there are a few options available:\n\n1. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs): These medications, such as donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Razadyne), work by increasing the levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in memory and cognitive function. ChEIs are approved for mild to moderate dementia and may help slow down the progression of",

While it's understandable that you're hesitant due to the lack of insurance, it's essential to prioritize your health and well-being.\n\nA sebaceous cyst is a common condition that occurs when the sebaceous glands in the skin become clogged and form a lump. In your case, since the cyst is large and has become harder, it's likely that it's not just a simple case of a clogged pore.\n\nPuncturing the cyst with a syringe might not have been the best approach, as it can lead to infection, inflammation, and potentially even scarring. I strongly advise against attempting to drain or puncture the cyst further without proper medical guidance.\n\nGiven your concerns about the cyst's size, hardness, and appearance, it's recommended that you consult a dermatologist or a general surgeon. Both specialists can assess the cyst and provide guidance on the best course of treatment.\n\nHere are your options:\n\n1. **Dermatologist:** A dermatologist is a specialist who focuses on skin, hair, and nail conditions. They can examine the cyst, take a biopsy (if necessary), and provide guidance on treatment options, including",

Potassium is an essential electrolyte that plays a crucial role in maintaining various bodily functions, such as heart rhythm, muscle contractions, and nerve function.\n\nConsidering your age and the fact that you're taking a water pill (hydrochlorothiazide) for blood pressure control, it's not uncommon for potassium levels to be slightly low. Hydrochlorothiazide can cause potassium levels to decrease by increasing urine production and reducing potassium reabsorption in the kidneys.\n\nThe APO-K Potassium Chloride - Slow-Release 600mg tablet your doctor has suggested is a reasonable treatment option to help increase your potassium levels. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Dose and duration**: The recommended dose of APO-K is one tablet daily, which is a relatively high dose. It's essential to monitor your potassium levels regularly to ensure they don't become too high. Your doctor may adjust the dose or discontinue the medication if necessary.\n2. **Interactions with other medications**: Since you're taking an adult coated aspirin daily, there's a potential interaction between the two medications",

The medications prescribed, Decolic drops and Neopeptine suspension, are commonly used to treat colic and gas in infants.\n\nSince your baby was doing okay yesterday but has become restless and crying a lot today, it's possible that the medications may be helping to alleviate some of the discomfort, but the underlying issue might not be fully resolved yet.\n\nHere are a few additional suggestions that may help:\n\n1. **Burping:** Make sure to burp your baby after feeding, especially after bottle-feeding. This can help release any trapped air that may be contributing to the discomfort.\n2. **Proper Latching:** If you're breastfeeding, ensure that your baby is latched on correctly. A proper latch can help reduce the risk of swallowing air, which can contribute to gas and indigestion.\n3. **Gripe Water:** In addition to the medications prescribed, you can try giving your baby a small amount of gripe water after feeding. Gripe water is a natural remedy that can help soothe the stomach and reduce gas.\n4. **Upright Positioning",

Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to help dilute the acidity in your stomach and alleviate the burning sensation.\n2.

        "generated": "\n\nI'm happy to help you with your husband's concerns about low sperm count, motility, and morphology.\n\nYou're correct that low iron levels can affect fertility, particularly sperm quality. Iron plays a crucial role in sperm production and function. However, before considering supplements, it's essential to determine if your husband indeed has iron deficiency or anemia.\n\nMultivitamins don't typically contain iron for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Individualized nutrient needs**: Iron requirements vary depending on factors like age, sex, diet, and health status. A multivitamin is designed to provide a broad range of essential vitamins and minerals, but it may not account for individual iron needs.\n2. **Risk of excessive intake**: Iron is a heavy metal that can be toxic in excess. Consuming high amounts of iron can lead to gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A multivitamin might not be the best way to ensure safe and effective iron supplementation.\n3. **Dietary iron sources**: A well-balanced diet that includes iron-rich foods like red meat, poultry, fish, beans, lentils, and fortified cereals can provide adequate iron. A multivitamin might not be necessary if your husband's diet is already rich in iron",

The skin color of a newborn baby is often paler or fairer because their skin contains a higher concentration of melanin, which is the pigment responsible for skin color. As the baby grows, the skin color may darken due to increased melanin production.\n\nRegarding your concerns about your baby's skin color, it's essential to consult a pediatrician for a thorough examination. The pediatrician will assess your baby's overall health, skin, and any other concerns you may have.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general tips to help maintain your baby's skin health:\n\n1. Keep your baby's skin moisturized: Use a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer on your baby's skin, especially after bathing.\n2. Protect your baby's skin from the sun: Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 30 or higher on your baby's skin, especially during outdoor activities.\n3. Maintain a healthy diet: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help support your baby's overall health, including skin health.\n\nRegarding the green marks",

Alzheimer's disease is a specific type of dementia that accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases.\n\nWhen someone is diagnosed with dementia, it's often because they have a combination of symptoms that don't fit neatly into one specific category. In many cases, the underlying cause of dementia is not immediately clear, and further evaluation is needed to determine the specific type or cause of the dementia.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain disorder that typically progresses gradually over time. It's characterized by the buildup of two types of proteins in the brain: beta-amyloid and tau. These proteins form sticky clumps called amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which damage brain cells and disrupt communication between them.\n\nIn some cases, someone with dementia may be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, but it's not always the case. Other types of dementia, such as vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, or frontotemporal dementia, can also cause similar symptoms.\n\nIt's possible for someone",

This is a common phenomenon, especially in people who are sensitive to changes in temperature.\n\nOther potential triggers for non-allergic rhinitis include:\n\n* Hormonal changes: Hormonal fluctuations during menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause can trigger non-allergic rhinitis.\n* Irritants: Exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke,",

However, I must advise you to avoid consuming alcohol, even in limited amounts, while you're still undergoing treatment for typhoid.\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection that can cause inflammation and damage to various organs, including the liver and spleen. In your case, the mild enlargement of these organs is likely a result of the infection. Consuming alcohol can further exacerbate this inflammation and potentially lead to more serious complications.\n\nAdditionally, antibiotics can interact with alcohol and increase the risk of adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain.\n\nIt's also important to note that typhoid can cause changes in the liver's ability to metabolize alcohol, making it more difficult for your body to process and eliminate it. This can lead to higher levels of alcohol in your bloodstream, which can increase the risk of alcohol-related problems.\n\nGiven your current condition and the fact that you're still on antibiotics, it's best to avoid consuming alcohol until your treatment is complete and your liver function has returned to normal. I would recommend waiting at least 2-3 weeks after completing your antibiotics before consuming any alcohol.\n\nIn the meantime, it's essential to continue",

I'm happy to help you explore the possible causes of the indentation on the top back of your skull.\n\nBased on your description, it's essential to consider a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Craniotomy scar**: It's possible that the indentation is a residual scar from a previous surgical procedure, such as a craniotomy (a surgical opening of the skull) or a craniectomy (a surgical removal of a portion of the skull). If you've had any head injuries or surgeries in the past, this could be a plausible explanation.\n2. **Depressed skull fracture**: Another possibility is that the indentation is a result of a depressed skull fracture, which occurs when the skull is cracked and the bone is pushed inward. This type of fracture can occur due to a head injury, and the soreness you experience when putting your hair up or randomly could be related to the bone's movement or irritation.\n3. **Bony prominence or abnormality**: It's also possible that the indentation is a natural bony prominence or abnormality, such as a small bump or a variation in the skull's shape. In some cases, these can be asymptomatic, but in others, they may cause discomfort or pain.\n4. **Other conditions",

This stitches usually get absorbed after 2-3 months. However, in some patients stitches can trigger inflammatory reaction. This results with lump creation. Other possibility is that your scar is growing and creating a keloid. Both conditions are not serious. But you should consult a surgeon with it. Hope this will help. Regards.",

I'll do my best to help you assess the situation.\n\nA red lump under the scar could be caused by several factors, including:\n\n1. **Infection**: It's possible that the surgical site has become infected, which can cause a red, swollen, and tender lump. This is more likely if you've noticed any increased redness, swelling, or pus around the area.\n2. **Hematoma**: A hematoma is a collection of blood that can form under the skin after surgery. It's possible that the hematoma has developed into a lump, which can be red and tender.\n3. **Suture reaction**: The sutures used during your surgery can cause an allergic reaction or irritation, leading to a red, itchy, or swollen lump.\n4. **Keloid or hypertrophic scar**: It's possible that the scar tissue is forming a keloid or hypertrophic scar, which can be red, raised, and itchy.\n\nGiven that the lump doesn't hurt unless you apply pressure, it's less likely to be a serious infection. However, it's still important to get it checked out to",

It may be due to traumatic injection given to you during treatment. It can cause injury at the injection site leading to lesion formation and pain. Other reason can be that in case of deeply infected tooth if the filling is done accidentally directly over the tooth nerves and blood vessels present in the central portion of tooth can cause inflammation of pulp and pus formation near the root tips of tooth causing lesion formation and pain. One reason can be that during treatment any instrument got accidentally injured the gums or the filling material got impacted into the gums causing infection. Treatment can be decided only after clinical examination by a dentist to rule out the cause for infection. By the time you can take painkiller like Ibuprofen if u have pain and not allergic. If the cause is due to filling over the nerves' removal of filling followed by root canal treatment and antibiotics can resolve the lesion. If infection is ruled out antibiotics can be helpful.

Based on your symptoms and test results, I'd like to explore some possible explanations for your peculiar symptoms.\n\nFirstly, it's great to hear that your spirometry shows no COPD, and your CT scan reveals only mild emphysema signs. This reduces the likelihood of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) being the primary cause of your symptoms.\n\nGiven that your oxygen saturation levels drop to 93-94% at rest, especially in a warm environment, I'd like to consider a few potential factors that might be contributing to your symptoms:\n\n1. **Cold-induced vasodilation**: When you breathe cold air from the AC, it may cause your blood vessels to dilate, which could improve oxygen delivery to your tissues. This could explain why your symptoms resolve when you're exposed to cold air.\n2. **Exercise-induced vasodilation**: Similarly, exercise can cause blood vessels to dilate, which may improve oxygen delivery and alleviate your symptoms.\n3. **Cardiovascular factors**: It's possible that your symptoms are related to cardiovascular issues, such as:\n\t* **Mitral valve prolapse**: This condition can cause irregular heart rhythms, which might lead to decreased oxygen saturation",

Gum recession can occur when the gum tissue around a tooth pulls back, exposing the root of the tooth or the bone underneath. This can be caused by various factors such as gum disease, toothbrush trauma, or genetic predisposition.\n\nIn your case, since you mentioned that the hole feels like you're touching the base of your lower wisdom tooth, it's possible that the recession is exposing the bone or the root of the tooth. The sensation you described, where it feels like you're touching the base of your wisdom tooth, is consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nAs for whether the hole will heal by itself, it's unlikely. Gum recession can lead to further bone loss and tooth mobility if left untreated. Additionally, the exposed root of the tooth can be sensitive to hot and cold temperatures, and may be more prone to decay.\n\nHowever, it's possible that the gum tissue may grow back over time, but this is not a guarantee.

But one thing should be known that the size of penis does not determine the potency of an individual. So, stop worrying about this. Also do not get influenced by any over the counter medication which claim to increase the size of penis or improve performance...it may be harmful. Having a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts & honey increase blood flow to penis & maintains erection. Avoid stress...practice meditation.this helps in improving concentration & builds up the confidence level. Avoid smoking & alcohol.

This condition is characterized by persistent fatigue that's not relieved by rest and is accompanied by other symptoms like muscle pain, joint pain, and headaches.\n2. **Post-viral syndrome**: Mono is caused by a viral infection, and in some cases, the virus can leave behind lingering symptoms. It's possible that you're experiencing a post-viral syndrome, where your body is still recovering from the initial infection.\n3. **Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus**: Mono is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In some cases, the virus can reactivate, leading to symptoms similar to those experienced during the initial infection.\n4. **Other underlying conditions**: It's also possible that there's an underlying condition",

However, the heavy, thick brown blood you're experiencing now is a different story.\n\nGiven that you've had unprotected sex at least once, it's possible that you could be pregnant.

The symptoms are actually related to the size of the kidney stone, the location of the stone, type of stone and the duration of the stone. Many people in the general population have small stones and present with no symptoms. Its there normal for a CT scan to detect stones without any symptoms. It becomes a worry when symptoms like pain, urination difficulties, infections and kidney failure come into play. However, regular clinical, biological and radiologic monitoring by your treating physician remains well indicated. Thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD.",

The constant urge to urinate and the feeling of incomplete emptying of the bladder are common symptoms of a kidney stone attempting to pass through the urinary tract.\n\nThe fact that you're experiencing no pain, no blood in your urine, and no fever suggests that the stone is likely moving through your system without causing any significant inflammation or obstruction. The mild discomfort in your pelvic region could be related to the stone's movement or the stretching of the urethral sphincter as it tries to pass.\n\nIt's also possible that the stone has already passed through your ureter and is now in your bladder, causing the symptoms you're experiencing. The discomfort and urge to urinate could be due to the stone's presence in the bladder, causing irritation and stimulating the bladder muscles to contract.\n\nGiven your symptoms, it's likely that the stone is still in the process of passing through your urinary tract. I would recommend monitoring your symptoms closely and keeping an eye on your urine output and color. If the stone does pass, you may notice a sudden increase in urine output or a change in the color of your urine.\n\nIn the meantime, it's essential to stay hydrated",

It's not uncommon for patients with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) to experience fluctuations in platelet counts when taking steroids.\n\nSince you've noticed that your platelet count increases when you take 10mg of Dexa, it's likely that the medication is helping to stabilize your platelet count. However, when you decrease the dose, your platelet count goes down, which suggests that the medication is still necessary to maintain a healthy platelet count.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to consider:\n\n1. **Consult your doctor**: I would recommend discussing your concerns with your doctor and asking if there are any adjustments that can be made to your medication regimen. Your doctor may be able to increase the dose of Dexa or switch you to a different medication to help stabilize your platelet count.\n2. **Monitor your platelet count**: Regular monitoring of your platelet count is crucial to ensure that your treatment is effective and to make any necessary adjustments.

Use the hot water bag wrapped in towel.  This will provide deep heating effect. Continue this along with the medicines you are taking. And also keep the pillow underneath the knee. If you aren't diabetic than please use icing for the lower back region.  This will provide the anesthetic effect and reduce the sensory functions by which the pain will come down.  As pain travels by the nerve, rather using a steroid shot it's better to use icing which is non-invasive and no side effects. Wait and see if the knee is any better.  If diabetic you can use hot water bag in the lower back which will slow down the sensory system by dilation effect. Once the pain comes down kindly try doing knee bending and extending. If that is possible you can possibly do some exercises like static Qua Chat Doctor.  Kindly do on both sides the exercises, so the strength is equivalent.

Based on your symptoms, it sounds like you might be experiencing a condition called oral mucositis.\n\nOral mucositis is a common side effect of certain medications, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. It can cause painful sores or ulcers on the inside of the mouth, tongue, and lips.\n\nThe translucent and white, crusty appearance of the sores you described is consistent with oral mucositis. The burning sensation when eating or drinking is also a common symptom.\n\nTo help manage your symptoms, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Practice good oral hygiene: Gently rinse your mouth with a saline solution (1/4 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water) several times a day. You can also use a soft-bristled toothbrush to clean your mouth, avoiding the affected areas.\n2. Use a topical anesthetic: Apply a topical anesthetic, such as Orajel or Anbesol, to the affected areas to help numb the pain.\n3. Avoid spicy or acidic foods: Try to avoid eating foods that can irritate your mouth, such as spicy or acidic foods. Opt for bland, soft foods like yogurt, scrambled eggs, and mashed potatoes.\n",

From what I read in your post, it seems like the symptoms might be a consequence of thrombosed hemorrhoids (hard and painful). The conservative measures that might help you are warm baths; ice can relieve the pain of acute thrombosis; high-fiber diet (methylcelulose); stool softener; topical steroids can alleviate symptoms of itching and inflammation; topical nitroglycerin can also reduce symptoms, but it can have side effects like dizziness and hypotension.

In your case, since you've tried over-the-counter medications and the hemorrhoid is still present, it's possible that a more targeted approach is needed.\n\nI can offer you a few options:\n\n1. Sclerotherapy: A minimally invasive procedure where a solution is injected into the hemorrhoid to reduce its size and alleviate symptoms.\n2.

        "expected": "Hello there, Thanks for writing in. I learned from your writing that you have so far undergone 4 IVF cycles which were unsuccessful. Let me help you understand in this scenario the meaning of implantation failure.  When pregnancy test comes negative in two or more IVF cycles where 6 or more reasonably good quality embryos are transferred then it is assumed to be implantation failure which means the embryo has failed to get buried in the soil(which is endometrium). When the embryo is transferred, the endometrium needs to receive it with the help of finger like microscopic structures to help it get buried. And the endometrium can do it only within a very short time frame, usually 6 to 7\\u00a0days post ovulation. Sometimes this timeframe within which it can receive seems to be shifted either early in the cycle or later. By doing an ERA(Endometrium receptivity array) test we are able to predict this timeframe much precisely so that the embryo transfer can be timed accordingly.  2. The size of the uterus doesn't matter for pregnancy unless its tiny. 3. Progynova is not being used for increasing the size of uterus. Hope your question is satisfactorily answered. Good luck.",
        "generated": "\n\nI'd be happy to help you understand the ERA report and its significance in your IVF journey.\n\nERA stands for Endometrial Receptivity Array. It's a genetic test that evaluates the genetic material of the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus. The test looks at the genes that are expressed in the endometrium during the window of implantation, which is around the time of embryo transfer.\n\nIn your case, the doctor has suggested an ERA report, which indicates that your endometrium is receptive to implantation. The \"p+5\" notation means that the test has identified a specific pattern of gene expression that is associated with a receptive endometrium.\n\nThe ERA test is useful because it can help identify potential issues with implantation, such as a mismatch between the endometrium and the embryo. By identifying these issues, the doctor can make adjustments to the IVF protocol to improve the chances of successful implantation.\n\nNow, regarding the uterus size before transfer, a normal uterus size is usually around 3-4 cm in diameter. However, the size of the uterus is not the only factor that determines the success of IVF. The quality of the endometrium, the embryo, and the timing of transfer are all important",

I'm happy to help you with your concern about unwanted hair on your cheeks and below your eyes.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that unwanted hair can be caused by hormonal imbalances, genetics, or certain medical conditions. Before we discuss treatment options, I would like to recommend a consultation with a dermatologist to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your hair growth.\n\nNow, let's discuss the treatment options you've mentioned:\n\n1. Laser Hair Removal:\nLaser hair removal is a popular and effective method for removing unwanted hair. It works by targeting the hair follicle with a laser beam, which damages the follicle and prevents future hair growth. However, it may require multiple sessions, and the results may vary depending on your skin type, hair color, and the area being treated.\n\nAs for side effects, laser hair removal can cause:\n\n* Mild redness and swelling\n* Temporary pigmentation changes\n* In rare cases, scarring or burns\n\nIt's crucial to find a qualified and experienced practitioner who uses a suitable laser technology and follows proper safety protocols to minimize the risk of side effects.\n\n2. Creams for Permanent Hair Removal:\nThere are several creams available that claim to remove unwanted hair permanently. However,",

A hernia can cause pain in the low back, especially if it's pressing on surrounding nerves or organs.\n2.

As the saliva is re-circulated through your mouth, it can deposit these substances onto the gums and teeth, causing the staining.\n\nThe good news is that this type of staining is generally reversible and not a cause for concern. However, it's essential to note that frequent and heavy use of smokeless tobacco products can lead to more serious health issues, such as:\n\n1. Gum disease (gingivitis and periodontitis): The bacteria in your mouth can thrive on the sugar and starch in the tobacco, leading to inflammation and infection of the gums.\n2. Tooth decay: The acidity in the tobacco can er",

This will help lock in moisture and reduce dryness.\n2. Hydrocortisone cream: A low-potency hydrocortisone cream (1%) can help reduce inflammation and itching. Apply a thin layer to the affected area 2-3 times a day for up to 2 weeks.\n3. Exfoliants: Gently exfoliate the area with a gentle cleanser containing alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs) 1-2 times a week. This will help remove dead skin cells and promote cell turnover.\n4. Vitamin E oil: Apply a few drops of vitamin E oil to the affected area ",

I'm happy to help you understand the benefits of the medications you're taking.\n\nClomifene (also known as Clomiphene Citrate) is a medication commonly used to induce ovulation in women with ovulation disorders. In your case, it's being used to stimulate your ovaries to release a mature egg, increasing the chances of a successful pregnancy.\n\nThe benefits of Clomifene include:\n\n1. Increased chances of ovulation: Clomifene can help your ovaries release a mature egg, which can increase the chances of getting pregnant.\n2. Improved ovulation rate: Clomifene can help regulate ovulation, making it more likely that you'll release a healthy egg.\n3. Reduced risk of miscarriage: By inducing ovulation, Clomifene may reduce the risk of miscarriage due to chromosomal abnormalities.\n\nAspirin is being used in combination with Clomifene to help thin the lining of your uterus, making it more receptive to implantation of a fertilized egg. This is often referred to as \"luteal phase support.\"\n\nThe benefits of Aspirin in this context include:\n\n1. Improved uterine receptivity: By thinning the uterine lining, As",

Fatty tissue can be a normal finding in some cases, but it can also be a sign of an underlying condition.\n\nGiven that the lump formed immediately after the accident and was not present before, it's possible that the trauma from the accident caused a type of fat necrosis. Fat necrosis is a condition where fat cells die due to injury or trauma, leading to the formation of a lump or mass.\n\nFat necrosis can occur in response to blunt trauma, such as in your case, where the force of the accident caused damage to the underlying tissue. The MRI finding of fatty tissue could be a sign of fat necrosis, which would explain why the lump formed immediately after the accident.\n\nIt's also possible that the trauma caused inflammation and scarring, which can lead to the formation of a lump or mass.

However, here are some general guidelines:\n\n* Mild strains: 2-4 weeks\n* Moderate strains: 4-6 weeks\n* Severe strains: 6-12 weeks or more\n\nKeep in mind that these are general estimates, and the healing process can vary significantly from person to person.\n\nIn the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your prescribed medications as directed and following these tips to",

When it happens, the blood flowing through the vessels from heart to brain might have a reduced flow. These are by the carotid and vertebral arteries on either sides. This is more significant when you are standing upright and doing any moderate to heavy physical activity. You might require a CT scan or MRI scan of the brain. The best way to analyze if the reduced blood flow to the brain is causing your dizziness is by doing a carotid and vertebral arteries Doppler ultrasound. It will show the flow of blood from the heart to the brain and if it is adequate. Clinical examination of inner ear and vestibular system in the ear is also required. It might help to do an Electronystagmography (ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG) done to record abnormal eye movements while the head is placed in different positions or your balance organs are stimulated with water or air. For this you might have to consult the ENT specialist. Dizziness can also occur due to stress related anxiety or overflow of emotions.",

Given your symptoms, I'll consider a few possibilities.\n\nSince your chest x-ray and other breathing tests (e.g., spirometry) are normal, it's unlikely that there's a significant lung disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contributing to your symptoms. The fact that you can exercise without issues suggests that your cardiovascular system is functioning properly.\n\nGiven that talking triggers your shortness of breath, I'd like to explore a few potential explanations:\n\n1. **Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD)**: This is a condition where the vocal cords close or spasm, causing respiratory distress. It's often seen in individuals with anxiety, stress, or vocal cord inflammation. Since you mentioned it started recently, it's possible that VCD might be playing a role.\n2. **Respiratory muscle weakness**: Weakness in the diaphragm or other respiratory muscles can lead to shortness of breath, especially during speech. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as a recent viral infection, medication side effects, or an underlying neuromuscular disorder.\n3. **Anxiety or stress-induced hyperventilation**: In some cases, individuals may experience shortness of breath due to anxiety or stress, particularly",

It's typically acquired through contact with contaminated animal products, such as unpasteurized milk, cheese, or meat. The infection can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, joint pain, fatigue, and headache.\n\nWhile it's possible to develop chronic undulant fever, it's relatively rare.

However, in some cases, the infection can persist or relapse, leading to chronic symptoms.\n\nThe diagnosis of chronic undulant fever is often challenging, as the symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions, such as fibromyalgia or rheumatoid arthritis. However, there are some laboratory tests that can help confirm the diagnosis:\n\n1.

Spotting or bleeding is a common side effect of Implanon, especially during the first few months after insertion. However, in your case, the spotting seemed to resolve with the use of birth control pills.\n\nNow, regarding the possible link between marijuana use and the return of spotting:\n\nMarijuana contains THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which can interact with the body's endocannabinoid system. While there is limited research on the specific effects of THC on hormonal contraception, some studies suggest that THC may:\n\n1. Affect hormone levels: THC can increase the levels of certain hormones, including cortisol, in the body. This could potentially disrupt the balance of hormones in your body, leading to changes in menstrual bleeding patterns.\n2. Influence the liver's metabolism: THC can affect the way the liver processes certain medications, including hormonal birth control.

This occurs when the joints between the vertebrae become inflamed or irritated, leading to pain and stiffness in the affected area.\n\nThe pain you experience during physical activity is likely due to the mechanical stress and strain placed on the joints, which can exacerbate the inflammation and irritation.\n\nAs for whether this condition will eventually go away on its own, it's possible but not guaranteed. If the condition is left untreated, it can persist and potentially lead to chronic pain and stiffness.\n\nI would recommend consulting with a physician, such as an orthopedic specialist or a physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) physician, to determine the best course of treatment for your specific condition.

Although the low back pain may be related to a faulty posture, the first thing that we need to do is rule out an arthritis which could be involving several joints. The conditions I would like to rule out are rheumatoid arthritis, infectious arthritis and a seronegative spondyloarthropathy. I would suggest you see an orthopedic surgeon at the earliest. We would need to run some tests and do a proper examination so that a proper cause can be found and treatment can be started. Hope this helpsRegards",

The fact that you're still experiencing twinges 14 days after stopping the medication is unusual and may indicate a lingering effect.\n3. **Dosage and duration of treatment**: Taking 4 tablets of Keflex 500mg per day for 6.5 days is a relatively high dose and prolonged treatment duration. This might have contributed to the severity and duration of the adverse effects.\n4. **Possible mechanisms**: Cephalexin, like other cephalosporins, can cause gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

The shot works by suppressing ovulation, and it can take several months for your body to regain its natural ovulation cycle.\n\nSince you've been off the shot for 9 months, it's likely that your body has started to recover from the suppressive effects of the medication. The dark brown spotting you experienced could be a sign of a normal menstrual cycle starting to return. However, it's essential to keep in mind that spotting can also be a normal part of the transition period after stopping hormonal birth control.\n\nGiven your history of using the Depo-Provera shot for 4 years, it's possible that it may have affected your fertility. The shot can cause changes in cervical mucus, ovulation, and even affect the quality and quantity of sperm. However, these effects are usually temporary and reversible.\n\nTo increase your chances of getting pregnant, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Keep tracking your menstrual cycle",

The surgery is usually recommended to prevent future episodes of pancreatitis and to reduce the risk of the cyst growing or causing other complications.\n\nRegarding the survival rate for surgery, it's generally very high. According to the American College of Surgeons, the mortality rate for pancreatic surgery is around 1-2%. This means that out of 100 patients who undergo surgery, 1-2 may not survive the procedure.\n\nAs for the invasiveness of the surgery, pancreatic surgery can be complex and requires a skilled surgeon. The procedure typically involves a laparoscopic or open approach, depending on the size and location of the cyst.\n\nLaparoscopic surgery involves making several small incisions in the abdomen and using a camera and specialized instruments to remove the cyst. This approach is generally less invasive and may result in less pain, scarring, and recovery time compared to open surgery.\n\n",

It's essential to consider the risks and benefits of surgery during pregnancy.\n\nIn general, sinus surgery is considered safe during pregnancy, but it's crucial to discuss the risks and benefits with your ENT specialist and an obstetrician. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that sinus surgery can be performed during pregnancy, but it's recommended to wait until the second trimester (weeks 14-26) when possible.\n\nHowever, in your case, it seems like you're experiencing severe symptoms, and your doctor has recommended surgery. It's essential to discuss your pregnancy with your ENT specialist and obstetrician to determine the best course of action.\n\nHere are some factors to consider:\n\n1. Risk of miscarriage: There is a small risk of miscarriage associated with general anesthesia, which is typically used for sinus surgery. However, this risk is low, and many women have undergone successful sinus surgery during pregnancy.\n2. Fetal development: The second trimester is generally considered a safe period for surgery, as the risk of miscarriage is lower, and the fetus is more developed.\n3. Alternative treatments: Your doctor may consider alternative treatments, such",

This can lead to micro-tears in the muscle fibers, causing pain and stiffness.\n2. **Poor posture or biomechanics**: The way you walk, stand, or sit can put uneven stress on your hamstrings, leading to discomfort and pain. This is especially common if you have a tendency to overpronate or supinate your feet.\n3. **Musculoskeletal imbalances**: Weak or tight muscles in other areas, such as your glutes, quads, or lower back, can pull on your hamstrings and cause pain.

The good news is that your liver enzymes have started to improve, which suggests that your liver is responding well to the abstinence from alcohol.\n\nRegarding your question about resuming occasional wine consumption, I would advise caution. While it's possible to have an occasional glass of wine without causing significant harm, it's essential to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Your liver enzymes: As you've already experienced elevated liver enzymes, it's crucial to monitor them closely. If they remain normal or near-normal, it may be possible to reintroduce small amounts of wine.\n2.

Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\nCerazette is a progestogen-only pill (POP), also known as the \"mini-pill.\" It works by thickening the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg. If you forget to take your pill, the effectiveness of the method may be reduced.\n\nAccording to the Cerazette patient information leaflet, if you forget to take your pill and you are more than 3 hours late, you should use an additional method of contraception, such as a condom, for the next 48 hours. This is because the POP may not be as effective if you're more than 3 hours late taking it.\n\nHowever, since you took the missed pill and today's pill together, and you haven't had sex in the past 7 days, the risk of pregnancy is relatively low. The British Association of Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) recommends using an additional method of contraception for 7 days after a missed pill, but this is not a universal recommendation.\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of emergency contraception (EC) depends on various factors, including the type of pill",

Re-infection of the root canal treated tooth can be the cause for the swelling, tenderness and pain in the region leading to the abscess formation.

If not periapical surgery can also help you. For the pain take ibuprofen tab (if you are not allergic to any medicine).

The fact that the patient has a history of root canal and crown placement in 1999 could be relevant to this diagnosis.\n\nThere are a few possibilities to consider:\n\n1. Periapical abscess: This is a common complication of endodontic treatment, where bacteria can escape from the root canal and cause an abscess to form around the apex of the tooth. The symptoms described, including throbbing pain and pain with pressure, are consistent with this diagnosis.\n2. Periapical cyst: A periapical cyst is a benign, fluid-filled sac that can develop around the apex of a tooth as a result of chronic inflammation. While it's not as common as an abscess, it's still a possibility.\n3. Sinusitis: Although the patient doesn't report any sinus symptoms, it's possible that the raised area is related to a sinusitis or a nasal polyp that's causing pressure and pain in the area.\n\nTo further evaluate",

Based on your symptoms, I'm going to take a closer look at what might be going on.\n\nFirstly, the white coating on the back and middle part of your tongue, along with the salty taste in your mouth, could be indicative of a fungal infection, such as oral thrush. This is often caused by an overgrowth of Candida yeast, which can be exacerbated by antibiotics like Keflex. The fact that you've been taking Keflex for your sinus and allergy issues might be contributing to this.\n\nThe low-grade fever you're experiencing could be related to the fungal infection or potentially another underlying condition. Given your history of asthma and acid reflux, it's possible that your symptoms are related to a respiratory or gastrointestinal issue.\n\nThe thirst and lack of appetite you've been experiencing could be due to a few factors. On one hand, it's possible that the Keflex is causing dehydration, which would explain the thirst. On the other hand, the fungal infection or another underlying condition could be affecting your appetite and overall sense of well-being.\n\nGiven your complex medical history, it's essential to rule out any potential interactions or side effects between your medications.

For one, cholesterol levels actually normally rise during pregnancy, because cholesterol is used to make a lot of the hormones and developing tissues, such as the brain, in the fetus. For that reason, many medical professionals do not recommend any woman of reproductive age to start using cholesterol-lowering medication. The other reason is that the chance at your age of your actually having a heart attack or stroke just from high cholesterol is still extremely low. At your age, the likelihood of your having problems conceiving are relatively low and the best way to have a healthy pregnancy is to be healthy before you get pregnant. So I recommend following your doctors instructions regarding cholesterol-lowering medication, and delaying pregnancy until your cholesterol is under better control. In addition to medications there may be diet and exercise recommendations that your doctor may have which will put you in a better state of health then you are right now. So in summary, high cholesterol does not affect the fetus in any negative way, and the body actually makes more cholesterol during pregnancy to provide the fetus with nutrition. However, cholesterol-lowering medication can actually harm the fetus by decreasing cholesterol levels to the point where the proper development of the fetus could be compromised. So in order to both keep the baby safe and improve your health I would recommend delaying pregnancy until after you've worked with your primary physician in order to lower your cholesterol and get your body into a healthier state to prepare for pregnancy. You should be off cholesterol-lowering medication at the time you are trying to conceive. In the long run, missing high cholesterol medication for about a year especially at your young age and if you do not have any other cardiac risk factors, will not do harm to you. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,",
        "generated": "\n\nThank you for sharing your laboratory results with me. Based on your numbers, you have hypercholesterolemia, specifically elevated LDL cholesterol, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n\nAs you plan to become pregnant, it's essential to consider the potential risks and benefits of your current lipid profile. Elevated cholesterol levels during pregnancy can increase the risk of:\n\n1. Fetal growth restriction: High cholesterol levels may reduce blood flow to the placenta, potentially affecting fetal growth and development.\n2. Preterm labor: Elevated cholesterol levels have been linked to an increased risk of preterm labor and delivery.\n3. Fetal distress: High cholesterol levels may also increase the risk of fetal distress, which can lead to complications during delivery.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that untreated hypercholesterolemia during pregnancy may increase the risk of maternal complications, such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and placental abruption.\n\nGiven your current lipid profile, I would recommend discussing the following options with your healthcare provider:\n\n1. Lifestyle modifications: Before considering medication, we can try to optimize your lifestyle to improve your lipid profile. This may include:\n\t* A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins\n\t*",

The sudden large twitching of his body is an interesting additional symptom.\n\nGiven the patient's history of lower back pain for 3 years and the recent diagnosis of Thornwaldt's cyst, it's possible that the cyst is contributing to the back pain. Thornwaldt's cyst is a benign lesion that typically develops in the petrous bone of the temporal bone, but it can also occur in other areas, including the spine.\n\nRegarding the twitching, it's possible that it's related to the patient's lower thoracic spine, as you mentioned. The lower thoracic spine (T10-L1) is a common area for muscle spasms and twitching, especially when the patient is relaxed. This region is also prone to referred pain patterns, which could be contributing to the patient's lower back pain.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider other potential causes for the twitching, such as:\n\n1.

The injury could have been a strain or a bruise, which may have developed over time due to repetitive stress or overuse.

By the time you finished the marathon, the injury may have become more pronounced, leading to the bruise you see now.\n2. **Peroneal strain or bruise**: The area you described, from ankle to mid-calf, is a common location for peroneal strains or bruises. The peroneal muscles run along the outside of the lower leg and can be prone to injury, especially during activities that involve repetitive ankle movements, such as running.

The diagnosis is suspected on the ECG and confirmed by ultrasound. Among the causes of left ventricular hypertrophy are age, intensive practice of one or more sports, obesity, prolonged hypertension. The seriousness of hypertension arises from its impact on a number of organs (target organs). The complications that can develop at their level explain the increased morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. The heart is one of the main target organs, and one of the first consequences of elevated blood pressure (PA) is left ventricular hypertrophy (HVG). The heart adapts to high blood pressure by increasing the volume, resulting in an increase in oxygen consumption by the heart muscle. As a result, coronary revascularization may gradually become insufficient. Progressively, the diastolic function (see DIASTOLE) then systolic (see SYSTOLE) will alter. In addition, this increase in volume of the left ventricle may cause ventricular rhythm disturbances (ventricular extrasystole for example) and poor revascularization of the deep layers of the myocardium (risk of INFARCTS).

Length of time you used chewing tobacco: The longer you used it, the longer it may take for the numbness to resolve.\n2.

The fact that it starts in your right hip and travels down to your foot suggests that the compression or irritation is occurring in the lower back, possibly in the lumbar spine.\n\nThe fact that your back brace provides some relief suggests that it may be helping to stabilize your spine and reduce the pressure on the sciatic nerve.

This pain could be due to:\n\n1. Post-operative inflammation or adhesions: Scar tissue may have formed during the surgical procedure, which could cause discomfort or pain.\n2. Endometriosis: Although the cyst has been removed, it's possible that endometrial tissue may still be present in the area, causing pain.\n3. Ovarian remnant syndrome: In some cases, a small portion of the ovary may remain after surgical removal, leading to ongoing pain.\n\n**Back pain on the left side:**\nThe development of back pain on the left side could be related to:\n\n1. Referral pain: Pain from the right ovary or adnexa (the area surrounding the ovary) may be radiating to the left side, causing back pain.\n2.

So consult doctor and get done ECG, 2d echo and Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about arrhythmia or other heart diseases. You are also having breathlessness. So chances of COPD (emphysema or bronchitis) is also high as you are a active smoker. Smokers are prone ti develop emphysema after the age of 40 years.

Blood group and blood loss: As a Rh-positive individual, you have antibodies against the Rh antigen, which can trigger an immune response if your wife's Rh-negative blood is exposed to your blood. However, this is not directly related to the excessive blood loss she experienced during delivery. The most likely cause of her death was likely due to hemorrhage (bleeding) caused by uterine atony, placental tears, or other obstetric complications, rather than her blood type.\n\nIn the case of an Rh-negative mother and an Rh-positive father, there is a risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) if the baby is Rh-positive. This is because the mother's immune system may produce antibodies against the Rh antigen, which can cause the baby's red blood cells to be destroyed. However, this is typically managed with proper prenatal care, and the risk of severe complications is low.\n\n2.

Usually it will take at least 1 month to recover. For some it may prolong till 6 months. If no improvement with conservative therapy surgical treatment can be considered. Hope this may help you.

The 60% ejection fraction indicates that her heart is not pumping efficiently, which is contributing to her symptoms.\n\nThe normal results from the cardiac catheterization and chest X-ray suggest that there is no significant blockage in her coronary arteries or fluid accumulation in her lungs, which is good news. However, the scarring in her right lung from the recent infection could be contributing to her symptoms, especially if it's causing her to breathe more heavily or shallowly.\n\nGiven her symptoms and diagnosis, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Adjusting her medication regimen: Her healthcare provider may need to adjust the dosage or type of medication she's taking for CHF and her diuretic to better manage her symptoms.\n2.
