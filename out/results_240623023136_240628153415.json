Hair loss can be caused by many factors, such as hormonal imbalance, genetics, stress, poor nutrition, infections, autoimmune disorders, etc. So, it is important to identify the cause of your hair loss. If you have a history of hair loss or if your parents also have hair loss, it could be due to genetics. If you are under stress, it could be due to stress. If you have a history of infections, it could be due to infection. If you are malnourished, it could be due to malnutrition.

Jaundice is a symptom of liver disease. If the liver is not functioning well, it is not able to remove bilirubin from the blood, and bilirubin accumulates in the blood, causing jaundice. So, it is necessary to rule out any liver disease.  If the LFTs are normal, then you should get your hemoglobin and other blood counts checked.  Jaundice can also be caused by anemia.  I would suggest you to consult a doctor and get yourself checked.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards Jay In Chat Doctor.

If I were your doctor, I would advise you for some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food and also to avoid any alcoholic beverages and smoking if you do. Also, a regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness would also be helpful. In addition, I would also go for a CBC, serum amylase and lipase, and an LFT to rule out the chances of this being a chronic pancreatitis. An abdominal ultrasound would rule out the pathology in the liver, and a recurrent stone in the common bile duct (CBD). Till the reports of all these investigations along with the result of a clinical assessment are available, I would advise you for an anti-spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor Chat Doctor. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

You have been having stones removed from the bile duct. Gallstones are the stones that form in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small organ that stores bile, which is produced by the liver. Bile is a greenish liquid that is produced by the liver and is stored in the gallbladder. When food enters the small intestine, the gallbladder contracts and releases bile into the small intestine. The bile helps to break down the fats in the food into smaller particles, which are then absorbed by the body. If the gallbladder is not functioning properly, the bile becomes thick and forms stones. The stones are usually small and pass through the bile ducts and into the intestine without causing any problems. However, in some cases, the stones become large and block the bile ducts, causing a blockage. In such cases, the stones need to be removed. The gallbladder is not essential for the digestion of food. The liver can produce bile without the gallbladder. So, the gallbladder can be removed. The liver will continue to produce bile, and the bile will",

        "generated": " Hello, I am Chat Doctor. I have read your query. In your mother's case, there is a possibility that her iron deficiency anemia is due to her asthma. Iron deficiency anemia is a condition in which there is a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin in the red blood cells. Iron is essential for the production of hemoglobin. The symptoms of anemia are fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, and cold hands and feet. Your mother is also asthmatic and asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes airways to become swollen, irritated and inflamed. The inflammation and swelling of the airways cause the muscles around the airways to tighten and the airways to become even narrower. The combination of iron deficiency anemia and asthma may be the cause of her low hemoglobin. Iron supplements and injections are the common treatment for anemia. Iron supplements are given to increase the iron levels in the body. Iron injections are given to increase the hemoglobin levels in the blood. The iron supplements and injections are effective in increasing the hemoglobin levels and improving the overall health of the patient. I hope this answer helps you.

        "expected": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Typically, women are advised to start birth control pills within seven days of their last menstrual period because it is unlikely that she would've already ovulated at that time.  If you start the pill later in your cycle, the process initiates ovulation may have already begun and your body may produce an egg that is capable of being fertilized that cycle. However, even if you ovulated right when you started to take the pill, it is unlikely that the egg would still be viable to be fertilized after seven days.  Therefore, waiting seven days before having unprotected intercourse most likely was enough time to ensure that you would not become pregnant. Modern pregnancy tests will become positive within 10 days to two weeks after conception, so if you do not have a menstrual period at the end of your pill pack, you should perform a urine pregnancy test to be safe. However, if you start your pill later than one week after the start of your period, you may not actually bleed the first month during the pill free week. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. Best wishes,",

However, if the blockage is caused by a blood vessel calcification then surgery is not the best option.

I would like to know more about your case, specifically the antibiotic you are taking, and the duration of the symptoms.

If you are taking an antibiotic for the first time, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to the antibiotic. This is a common side effect of antibiotics and it is usually self-limiting, meaning it will resolve on its own. If this is the case, you may need to stop taking the antibiotic and see your doctor for further evaluation. If you are not taking an antibiotic, I would recommend you to see your doctor to rule out other causes of your symptoms. You may have a urinary tract infection, kidney infection, or a kidney stone. Your doctor can order a urine culture to rule out a urinary tract infection, and a CT scan of the abdomen to rule out a kidney stone. Hope this helps, feel free to ask more questions.

If she doesn't have any symptoms then you shouldn't be worried. Usually when no cause is found then autoimmune hepatitis needs to be considered. Just often do examination and check enzymes levels, if any symptoms occur then further tests such as liver biopsy and CT must be done. Wish you good health",

She may have a viral hepatitis such as hepatitis B or C, or she may have a metabolic disorder such as tyrosinemia, which is a condition that causes high liver enzymes. She may also have a liver condition such as autoimmune hepatitis or a liver condition that is related to a genetic disorder. I would recommend that you consult with a pediatric gastroenterologist and have her undergo a liver biopsy. This will give you a better idea of what is causing the high liver enzymes. In the meantime, you can also give her a liver supplement such as Liv52. This will help to protect the liver and may help to lower the liver enzymes. I hope this information is helpful.

If you are not circumcised, the frenulum is usually located just under the glans and is easily injured.  In circumcised men, the frenulum is usually not visible.  In the case of a frenulum tear, it is usually an acute injury.  The frenulum is usually not able to heal on its own and may require surgical repair.  The scar tissue is usually not as strong as the original tissue and may not be able to withstand the same level of stress as the original tissue.  In the case of a frenulum injury, this means that it may be more prone to re-injury.  As for the size of the penis, it is not usually affected by a frenulum injury.  If the injury is severe, it may cause bleeding, bruising or swelling of the penis.  In some cases, it may cause a decrease in the ability to achieve an erection.  If you have a frenulum injury, you should seek medical attention.  The doctor will examine the penis to determine the severity of the injury.  He will then advise you on",

There are no medications or natural remedies that help dissolve the spur. Sometimes if the spur reduces the range of motion or cause significant pain then surgery to remove the spur is suggested. Hope this answers your question. Please contact us again with your questions.",
        "generated": " Hello, A wrist bone spur is a condition in which there is a small bony outgrowth in the wrist. The spur is usually a result of the tendons and ligaments in the wrist becoming inflamed and causing the bone to become irritated. There are several factors that can contribute to the development of bone spurs, such as arthritis, injury, and genetics. While calcium and vitamin D are important for bone health, I do not think that taking calcium and vitamin D supplements will help to get rid of the bone spur. The only way to get rid of a bone spur is through surgery, and this is usually only done if the spur is causing pain or is limiting movement in the wrist. If you are experiencing pain and limited movement in the wrist, then you should consult with a doctor to see if surgery is the best option for you. I hope this information is helpful.

Usually bruises might occur post surgery but in the initial stages and not the latter stages. Also, the pain coming depends on how better the post hip replacement rehabilitation was performed.  Sometimes due to muscle weakness some people develop some pain due to wasting of muscles and over strain of it. But again with a physical examination by the orthopedist and exercise things go well.

I think the bruise is due to the hematoma formation in the soft tissue. You can take a painkiller like diclofenac sodium for the pain. Apply warm fomentation for 5 minutes, 3 times a day. You can take a vitamin B complex tablet for the hematoma. If the bruise is not decreasing in size, you can consult your orthopedic surgeon. Hope this helps you. Regards Chat Doctor. V.

        "generated": " Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is not uncommon for a root canal treated tooth to develop a swelling on the side of the tooth. The swelling is usually due to an infection of the soft tissue of the gums, but it can also be due to a periosteal abscess. A periosteal abscess is an infection of the bone around the tooth. This usually happens due to a failure to treat the root canal properly. The root canal treatment is usually done to remove the infected pulp from the tooth. However, sometimes the infection can spread to the bone around the tooth. In such cases, the infection can develop into a periosteal abscess. It is not usually painful but it can be tender to the touch. It is not usually dangerous, but it can be a sign of an underlying infection of the tooth or the bone. In your case, since the pain has gone, it is likely that the infection has been treated. However, you should consult an endodontist to confirm that the root canal treatment was done properly. In such cases, the root canal treatment has to be redone and a crown has to be placed over the tooth to prevent further infections. I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.

The lymph nodes in the groin area are responsible for filtering out bacteria and other foreign substances from the genital area.

        "generated": " Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor. I read carefully your query and understand your concerns. The lump in the testicles is called a hydrocele, and it is a common condition. It is caused by a fluid accumulation in the testicular sac. The fluid is usually clear and does not contain any infection. This condition is not life-threatening, and it does not cause any other symptoms. If you are concerned about the lump, I would recommend a consultation with a Urologist to evaluate the lump. If the hydrocele is causing discomfort, it can be treated with a procedure called a hydrocele aspiration. In this procedure, a needle is inserted into the hydrocele and the fluid is removed. The procedure is done under local anesthesia, and it is painless. The fluid will return after some time, and you will need to repeat the procedure. If the hydrocele is large, it can be surgically removed. The surgery is called a hydrocele repair, and it is usually done under general anesthesia. The surgery is usually done as an outpatient procedure, and you will be able to go home the same day. In some cases, the hydrocele can be treated with a scrotal support or a scrotal compression garment. These support can be purchased over",

CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It acts as a shock absorber and helps to prevent the brain from getting injured. A concussion is a mild head injury. It is usually caused by a blow to the head, and can cause a range of symptoms including dizziness, confusion, memory loss, loss of balance, and blurred vision. The two tests that are done to diagnose a concussion are an MRI and a CT scan. The MRI is a magnetic resonance imaging test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. The CT scan is a computerized tomography test that uses X-rays to create detailed images of the brain. Both tests are usually done within a few hours of the injury. Hope this helps.

        "generated": " Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, it is not a cause of worry. It is a normal phenomenon. The nail plate is a dead tissue, and it does not grow from the nail bed. It grows from the nail matrix. The nail matrix is under the nail plate. The nail plate is attached to the nail bed by nail folds. These folds are present at the base of the nail plate. When the nail plate grows, these folds get pushed forward and the nail plate appears to be not attached to the nail bed. So this is a normal phenomenon. You need not worry about this. This will not lead to any infection or any other problem. So no need to take any treatment. I hope this will help you. Thanks. Take care. Wish you a very good health.

However, CEA is to be done regularly to know the progressive increase and possibility of a recurrence of the tumor. Colon cancer might cause liver spread and this also has to be looked for by doing an ultrasound scan and CT scan if required. It is important to discuss the rise on CEA with your doctor and then proceed with doing an ultrasound scan or CT scan and if there is a strong suspicion then a PET CT scan might be necessary. Please do not worry.",
        "generated": " Hello, I am Chat Doctor.  I have gone through your question and can understand your concerns.  CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) is a tumor marker, which is used to assess the presence and the response to treatment of the cancer.  It is not a definitive marker, and the results should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory parameters.  If the CEA is elevated, it does not necessarily mean that the cancer has recurred, but it may indicate the presence of the cancer cells in the blood or in the tissues.  In your case, the CEA is elevated, but it is still within the normal range, and it may not be a cause for concern.  However, it is always better to have a follow-up check-up to exclude the recurrence of the cancer.  I hope this answer helps you.  If you have any further questions, I will be happy to answer them.

You should consult an ENT specialist for proper diagnosis and treatment. Meanwhile, you can use a humidifier at home to relieve the postnasal drip. Take warm saline gargles 3-4 times a day. You can also use a nasal decongestant spray like Otrivin. I hope this helps! If you have further questions, feel free to ask! Regards, Chat Doctor. Lykaios. G. Lykaios, MD, PhD. ENT Specialist.

If you miss one pill but take it within 24 hours of when you forgot it, the effectiveness of the pill is not reduced, and you still rely on it as primary contraception.  However, one of the side effects of taking the pill at irregular intervals is having spotting when you are not supposed to have your period.  The brown discharge you see is actually very light bleeding and will usually stop within a few days after you take your pill at the same time every day. There are apps you can download (if you have a smartphone) or email programs on the internet that will send you a reminder to take your pill every day.  Or a good low-tech method to help you remember is to coordinate taking your pill with something you do around the same time every day (like brushing your teeth) so you get into a daily habit. I hope I adequately answered your question and that this information was reassuring.  Best wishes,",

If you have missed two pills in a row, you should take two pills on the same day. If you are more than two days late, you should take a combination of both estrogen and progesterone for 7 days.

But with lifestyle changes and medicine, it can be managed. So, you should not be confused about the medicine. It is good that you are taking medicine as per your doctor's advice. You should continue it for the next 2 months and then get a scan done to see if you have any follicles. If yes, you can take a medicine for ovulation and get a scan done after 2 weeks to see if you have a corpus luteum. If yes, you can get a pregnancy test after 2 weeks.

Trigeminal neuralgia is a nerve disorder that causes sudden, severe pain in the face. The pain is usually felt in the cheek, tongue, or gums, but it can also be felt in the forehead, nose, or chin. The pain is usually short, but it can recur several times a day. The pain can be triggered by touching the face, eating, brushing teeth, or even cold air. It can also be triggered by certain movements of the face or head. The pain is usually on one side of the face. Trigeminal neuralgia is usually caused by pressure on the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve is a nerve that supplies the face. It is the third cranial nerve. The trigeminal nerve runs through the face and provides sensation to the face. It also controls facial muscles. The trigeminal nerve runs through the face and is protected by a sheath of tissue called the dura mater. The dura mater is a thin layer of tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord.",

A bleeding disorder is a condition in which the blood does not clot properly. This is usually due to a problem in the platelets or the clotting factors in the blood. When a blood vessel is injured, it needs to form a clot to stop the bleeding. In a bleeding disorder, the blood vessels are unable to form a clot properly. This can cause the bleeding to be difficult to stop. The bleeding can be in any part of the body, and can be internal or external. It can be mild or severe. In some cases, it can be life-threatening. The treatment of a bleeding disorder depends on the severity of the bleeding. In some cases, the bleeding can be stopped by applying pressure to the affected area. In other cases, the patient may need to have blood transfusions to increase the platelet count or to replace the clotting factors. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to stop the bleeding. I hope that this helps you understand your mother's condition better. Please get back to me if you require any further assistance. Thanks and take care. Chat Doctor. .com.  ChatDoctor. ",

The treatment for plantar fasciitis involves stretching the calf area, applying ice, taking several medications such as ibuprofen.  Seeing a physical therapist can also help.  Bone spurs are very common and in themselves do not usually cause pain.  Most of the pain from plantar fasciitis comes from the soft tissues. Sometimes for severe plantar fasciitis I will prescribe a night splint. Surgery is almost never indicated for this condition. As regards the neck issue, it sounds as though this might be soft tissue in origin, particularly if your x-rays are negative.  You could be experiencing mild muscle spasm or a simple strain of the soft tissues in the cervical region.  It might be a good idea to pay a visit to a physical therapist who can teach you some stretches and some exercises to do at home. If your neck feels stiffer than simple applications of heat will help. I hope this information is useful for you. Please do not hesitate to message us back if you have any further questions.

You will need to consult your GP/ Family physician and get a few tests arranged first - Urine routine and culture (mid-stream urine please) and Ultrasound of Kidneys and bladder (pre- and post-emptying the bladder) at the very least. Some people tend to develop bladder diverticula or tend to retain some urine in bladder even after they think they have emptied it. Any stagnant urine is a good culture medium for bugs! I am not sure what these lumps you mention are - best to check out with a gynecologist. I don't want to just make some assumptions without examining someone and cause you to worry. It could be infection, warts, or something called endometriosis, or something else. Only after examination (and tests like a smear or biopsy) can we identify the problem.

Abdominal cramping is a common symptom in many diseases and can be due to many causes.  The most common causes of abdominal cramping are gastrointestinal disorders, and are usually relieved by antispasmodic agents like Buscopan or antacids.  Other causes of abdominal cramping are infections, inflammatory disorders and metabolic disorders, and need specific treatment.  Since your father is already on dialysis, and has comorbidities like CHF, DM and MI, the most likely cause of abdominal cramping is due to gastrointestinal disorders.  So, you should ask your father to take an antacid like Omeprazole and Buscopan.  If the cramping does not subside, then you should go back to your father and ask him to take a CT scan of the abdomen and ask the doctor to do an upper GI endoscopy.  This will help you to find out the cause of abdominal cramping and then you can start the treatment.  I hope this will help you.  If you have any further queries, I will be happy to help.

The pain had been in the center of the abdomen and shifted to the right lower abdomens is very classical of appendicitis. Appendicitis, even though a common surgical problem can present in many forms and is really very difficult in many cases. Usually a high resolution ultrasonography helps in a diagnosis and CT scan is confirmatory in almost all the cases. I would advise seeing a Gastroenterologist and request for a CT scan of the abdomen to get a proper diagnosis. If this is appendicitis, you have to undergo appendectomy operation as it is already late. Left sided mild pain can be due to spread of infection to this part of the abdomen.",
        "generated": " Hi, thanks for writing to us. I have read your query and I understand your concern. The pain in your abdomen is more on the right side. The appendix is usually on the right side. So it could be appendicitis. The appendix is a small tube in the right lower abdomen. It can become inflamed and painful. If it is inflamed it may rupture. So the doctors were correct in suspecting appendicitis. The pain is also on the left side because it is referred pain. The pain from the appendix is felt on the right side and the left side. The doctors in the emergency room suspected appendicitis because you had pain in the right lower abdomen and they were correct. So I would suggest you to consult your doctor and get an ultrasound of the abdomen done. If the appendix is inflamed or the appendix has ruptured then an operation is the only solution. So you should not delay in getting an ultrasound done and if the diagnosis is confirmed then you should get the operation done. I hope this helps. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Regards. Chat Doctor.

But if she is having pain in the mons pubis then you should consult a pediatrician for clinical examination of the child. If the clinical examination is normal then no need to worry much about the size of the mons pubis. The mons pubis is a fatty pad which is present at the junction of the abdomen and the thigh. It is normal to have some fat accumulation in the mons pubis. This fat accumulation is more in girls than in boys. So no need to worry much about the fat accumulation in the mons pubis.

Better get an Ultrasound Study done as well as routine blood test to rule out infection (Appendicitis), since Total count of WBC of more than 11000 with necrophilia is indicative of infection. Of course a surgeon can also provisionally diagnose appendicitis by eliciting rebound tenderness at McBirney Point. It is prudent to avoid blind treatment.

This trauma can be due to biting your cheek or tongue or any other object. So I suggest you to consult an oral physician and get an intraoral examination done. After examination, if doctor finds any trauma, then you need to follow few precautions to prevent further trauma. Apply topical anesthetic gel or gel containing antibiotics on the affected area. Avoid hard and chewy food items. Avoid using toothbrush and floss for 2-3 days. Avoid using mouthwash. If you don't find any trauma, then possibility of this bump and bruises is due to some other cause. So get an X-ray of that area to rule out any pathology like cyst or tumor. If you have any doubt then consult online doctor. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks. Chat Doctor. A. K. Jain.

The hallmark characteristics of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy are the presence of myoclonic jerks that occur on awakening from sleep either in the morning or from a nap. They are typically described as shock-like, irregular and arrhythmic movements of both arms. Sometimes these movements are restricted only to the fingers making the patient or individual look clumsy or prone to Chat Doctor.  They are precipitated by alcohol intake, stress and sleep deprivation. If you feel that the episodes are associated with above-mentioned symptoms, then an electroencephalogram (EEG) will be useful to detect any occult epilepsy. Else, you may start antacids for him to relieve gastric acidity which might be the cause of these episodes of vomiting. Hopefully this will help you. Take care",

From the nature and sudden onset of your symptoms after taking Doxycycline, it is possible that they could be indicative of an allergic reaction. Since you have stopped the medication and your symptoms are subsiding, you don't have to worry much. It may sometimes take a few days for your symptoms like tiredness and fatigue to completely settle down. I would advise you to take plenty of fluids and eat a healthy, nutritious diet. If your symptoms remain persistent or worsen, then I would advise you to see a doctor for further evaluation, since certain conditions like anemia or vitamin deficiencies can cause persistent fatigue.

Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that can cause allergic reactions, especially if you are allergic to penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotics.

White blood cells help protect the body against diseases and fight infections. There are numerous causes for increases in neutrophils, lymphocytes etc. but the most common cause of Leukocytosis is secondary to infection (localized or generalized)or tissue necrosis due to any cause, in your case it can be due to infection in your teeth. The degree of leukocytosis depends upon several factors like its cause, severity of the infection, resistance of the body, localization of the inflammatory process (greater neutrophil leukocytosis is produced by a localized disease process rather than a generalized one) and modification by treatment. Your WBC count is only slightly raised so don't worry. A course of antibiotics will bring it down. Take care!",

Smoking is also a major culprit that can cause these symptoms. The best thing to do is to quit smoking. If you cannot quit smoking, then you should at least reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke daily. You can also use an inhaler to help with your bronchial asthma.

You should consult with your doctor about what type of inhaler you need. Also, try to avoid places where there is smoke and pollution.

You are already taking Flexeril and Ibuprofen, but you should also consider the use of other medications such as Gabapentin, Ami Triptyline, and Cymbalta, which are very effective for the treatment of pain.

If the above said antibodies develop before the 1st childbirth(that means if blood transfusion done).,then 1st baby will affect.2. If the above said antibodies develop after the birth of 1st childbirth your 1st baby will be normal.and for second pregnancy these antibodies travel across placenta and make red cell to break in the baby. Rh means rhesus factor... Rh +ve means presence of Rh antigen in the blood.n\\u00e9 negative means absent. Regarding your query.you are O+ve and your would be is O-ve.

After the 1st pregnancy your wife had to receive anti D immunoglobulin to suppress her immune status because of babies blood.after taking of this anti D then further pregnancies would be normal.no problem will arise. Incompatibility doesn't cause thalassemia,it is an inborn genetic error in the red blood cells. There is no side effects to that injection.

In blood group incompatibility there is possibility of hemolytic disease in the fetus and this can be prevented by giving Rh immunoglobulin to the mother.

Gross hematuria can be seen with our eyes as red urine. There is another type called microscopic hematuria where red cells are seen under the microscope. If red cells or red cells casts are present in the urine along with protein in the urine it means there is a kidney problem especially in a structure called glomerulus. Red cells or Frank blood in the urine may occur more commonly due to stones. It may also be seen with certain infections. Above the age of 40, we also try to rule out the possibility of kidney or bladder cancer. Certain medicines and certain food items may color the urine red but in this case the urine report is negative for blood or red cells. A condition called hemoglobinuria where the muscles are affected may cause red urine. The first step therefore is to read the urine report.

If the X-ray is normal, then I would advise you to consult a neurologist who would examine you and would advise you some tests like EMG and NCV. If these tests are normal, then I would advise you to consult a physiatrist who would advise you some exercises and would help you in recovery. I would advise you to avoid weight bearing on the ankle for next 3-4 weeks. I would advise you to use an ankle support and to wear a shoe with a soft sole. I would advise you to consult a physiotherapist who would advise you some exercises to improve the blood circulation in the ankle and would help you in recovery. I hope my answer would be helpful for you. Please let me know if you have any follow up questions. Thank you. Take care. Regards. Chat Doctor. Jay",

Typical symptoms of bowels obstruction are nausea, vomiting, lack of stool and gasses, bloating and sometimes cramps. The other thing is that you have also urinating problems and back pain. This makes kidney infection very possible. Actually with bowels obstruction kidney infection can appear as you do not absorb water and do not urinate enough. Both conditions can be life-threatening. That is why you should not wait with them. Please go to ER. Urinalysis, abdominal x-ray and ultrasound are necessary. Surgery might be the only treatment. Hope this will help. Regards.",

I will try my best to answer your query think that there is some pathology developing in the back. This may be mild at the moment and may be gradually building up. So I would seriously suggest that you move for an imaging modality like MRI/X-ray (the former being the preferred modality). The physiotherapy is usually a good option for people who have backache. So look for a qualified physiotherapist around you who may help you with the pain and also the fomentation techniques.Painkillers may be taken once in a while, but I would suggest you avoid them as far as possible due to the possibilities of long term problems like gastritis and kidney damage hope this helps you.

The cause for compression of the nerve could be due to a herniated disc in the spine or due to a bone spur in the spine. The treatment for this condition is based on the cause of the compression of the nerve. If the cause is a herniated disc then the treatment is a course of physiotherapy and painkillers.

Let me first inform you that, if the stone size is less than 10 mm, then definitely there is a chance to flush it out from our body by specific medicines. In your case, the stone size is 18 mm, and also it is stuck in the ureter as informed by you, which is giving you severe pain. In my opinion, you can go ahead for surgery. Do not worry it will be not an open surgery. Lithotripsy is done in such cases, which is minimal invasive surgery. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any other questions, then I will be happy to answer it. Wish you good health. Take good care of yourself. Warm Regards.",
        "generated": " Hi, thanks for writing to us. I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. I would advise you to consult a urologist and get an ultrasound of the kidney done to confirm the size of the stone. This will also help you to confirm if the stone is in the kidney or has come out of the kidney. If the stone is in the kidney then it is usually removed by surgery. The stone can be removed by performing a PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotomY). The stone can also be removed by performing an ESWL (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy). This is a non-invasive procedure and is done under general anesthesia. The cost of the procedure varies depending on the hospital and the city. The cost of PCNL is around 2-3 lakhs and the cost of ESWL is around 1-2 lakhs. I hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to ask any further queries. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. S. V.

When you have an expired Implanon, there is a chance that you may still be protected from pregnancy. However, since you have not had your period for 3 months, it is possible that you have ovulated and may be pregnant. If you are sexually active, you should get a pregnancy test done to confirm whether you are pregnant or not. If you are pregnant, you should consult your doctor for prenatal care and for a check-up on the health of your pregnancy. If you are not pregnant, you can wait for another 3 months to see if your periods return. If your periods still do not return, you should consult your doctor to check for any underlying hormonal imbalance that may be causing your periods to stop. Hope this helps.

        "generated": " Hi, Thanks for consulting Chat Doctor. I read your query carefully. Blisters on gums can be due to various causes. The most common cause of blisters is the bite trauma. The trauma can be due to the sharp edge of tooth or a rough surface of the tooth. It can also be due to the sharp edge of the dental restoration or the rough surface of the dental restoration. I suggest you to consult your dentist and get the tooth checked. The dentist can check the tooth and the restoration. The dentist can also check the bite of the teeth. The dentist can also check the gum health. If the dentist finds the problem, the dentist can fix it. Hope this helps you. Thanks and Regards. Chat Doctor. V. Subrahmanyam.

        "expected": "Hi.thanks for your query. You need to know about the causes of dark lips to be taking precautions better. A lot of people have it genetically predetermined, although parents may/may not have it. A frequent cause of non-genetic lip darkening is the use of lipsticks /colored balms/gloss, as these tend to darken the lips over a period of time. So try and not use it too often. If you have to use it, then let it be alleged free and replace them every 2 months. I would advise you to start using medicated lip balms with SPF and to reapply it several times in a day.that helps in reducing further darkening. Definite cream or any others having Comic acid can be used twice a day for lightening of lip color. It usually does not have side effects. However u can check for tolerance of the product by applying it for a short time on the first application. If you have a genetic tendency to dark lips, the pigmentation has chances of coming back after the cream is stopped. U can also opt for mild chemical peels once in 15-30 days to exfoliate better and lighten faster. Take care!",

Even though it needs clinical assessment for a diagnosis, from your history, it seems that you have inflammation/calculi in your gall bladder/biliary system giving rise to such intermittent severe pain. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to avoid fatty/oily food which would precipitate the pain more due to contraction of the gall bladder to empty bile into the intestines.  I would advise you a bland diet, some routine investigations like a CBC, a blood sugar, liver function test, a serum amylase and lipase to rule out associated pancreatitis, and an ultrasound abdomen to see the status of the biliary tree including the gall bladder to exclude a stone causing cholecystitis and also to know the status of the pancreas. Further management would depend on the result of clinical examination and reports of the related investigations. Till then, you could go for an anti-spasmodic along with a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief.

So the changing of your due date by four days does not really change the possibility of your first partner having been the father of your baby. Furthermore, sperm can remain alive in your genital tract for up to five days, and once you ovulate, the egg remains alive inside you for up to 72 hours. This is the reason that no test can accurately assess the date of conception based on the exact dates that you had intercourse.  Women typically ovulate two weeks before their period arrives.  If you have a 28-day cycle, and your last period started on June 4, you likely ovulated around June 18. So either of the men you had sex with between the 15th and approximately the 20th could be the father of your baby. I hope that this information was helpful to you and that I was able to adequately answer your question even though it is not possible with medical science to determine the paternity of your pregnancy.

As the pain in the knee is persisting a thorough assessment is needed. Due to ligament injuries within the knee joint, such types of pain can be expected.

Also, undergoing an MRI of the knee should help understand the soft tissues better and then you have to undergo physical therapy for 2-3 weeks post which you can follow the exercises at home itself.

Palate sensitivity as you are having can be due to various reasons few being having scalding cup of coffee or some really hot and spicy food, which may burn the palate. Palate can also usually hurt when you have a bacterial or viral infection like throat, sinus infection, thrush or even the common cold. If you are under stress the formation of canker sores can also be a reason. I would advise to reduce the spicy food if you take any, and reduce the stress levels which can be increasing the problem. You can apply Mucosal/Denote for relief two to three times a day. Do warm saline gargling. Consult a GP and start with multivitamin. If still not better consult your dentist, and he will have a look at it and suggest the best possible treatment. Hope this was helpful. Thanks and regards. Any further queries are welcome.",

The choroid plexus cysts are very common and usually disappear by themselves. They are not related to any chromosomal anomalies. So you should not worry about the triple marker test. If the cyst persists at 20 weeks scan then it can be followed up at 28 weeks and 32 weeks scan. If it persists at 32 weeks scan then it can be followed up at 36 weeks scan and if it persists then it can be followed up at 38 weeks scan. If it is still present at 38 weeks scan then you need to have a cesarean section. So I would advise you to go for a follow up scan at 20 weeks and then at 28 weeks.

I will explain to you what is the meaning of HbSE and what is the treatment. HbSE is a kind of blood disorder, which is due to a mutation of the HBB gene. The HBB gene is responsible for the production of hemoglobin, which is a protein in red blood cells. Hemoglobin is responsible for carrying oxygen from lungs to body tissues and for carrying carbon dioxide from body tissues to lungs. In HbSE, there is a mutation of the HBB gene, which leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin. This abnormal hemoglobin is not able to carry oxygen and carbon dioxide properly, which can cause anemia. The treatment of HbSE depends on the level of hemoglobin in the blood. If the level of hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL, then blood transfusions are necessary. If the level of hemoglobin is more than 7 g/dL, then iron supplements are necessary.

If it is not related to Sarcoidosis or Lupus then you should go for evaluation of your hernia. Hernia can be operated. But it is not always possible to operate hernia.

Letrozole is a medication that is used to stimulate the ovaries to produce more eggs. It is often used in women who are having trouble ovulating. It is not a medication that is used to prevent pregnancy, but rather a medication that is used to help women produce more eggs. So, you are taking the right medication for your condition. If you have regular periods, then your chances of getting pregnant are quite high. However, you may want to consider getting an ultrasound done to confirm that your ovaries are functioning properly. It is also important to note that you are 28 years old and you have had two medical abortions, so you may want to consider getting a test to see if you are HIV positive. This is because the risk of getting HIV increases with each abortion. I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further queries. Thanks. Chat Doctor. S. K. Jain. MD, FICP, FICMAM, FCSI.

If you have such symptoms then you can go for throat swab to rule out H1N1. Only if cough lasting more than 2 weeks TB test will be required. Take plenty of fluids. Take chewable vitamin C also.

Your child has been diagnosed with viral upper respiratory tract infection, and is now diagnosed with bronchiolitis.  Bronchiolitis is a viral infection of the small airways of the lungs, which can be caused by many viruses, but the most common cause is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Your doctor is right in recommending nebulization therapy to help open up the airways and make it easier to breathe.  I recommend that you continue with this therapy as prescribed by your doctor.

They can cause side effects like stomach upset, dizziness, drowsiness and allergic reactions. If your father is not responding to these pain relievers, you can ask your doctor to prescribe other options like tramadol, pregabalin, duloxetine, amitriptyline, etc. These medicines are good for chronic pain and have less side effects.

As it's a vestigial organ, its always removed by surgery. Its produces symptoms like vomiting, pain initially on the left side of the lower abdomen and later pain migration to right side of stomach. Chronic appendicitis is more dangerous in terms of complication as its more prone to produce spreading infection at the time of surgery...it can also be prone to rupture further complicating surgery, affecting nearby bowel loops causing \\\"gangrenous appendicitis\\\" as in your case. You underwent your surgery at this stage of the disease.a more comprehensive approach is needed at the earliest, would have saved some of those bowel loops and prevented serious peritoneal infection in your case, anyhow now you are operated and the infective focus removed, you are out of danger, and you will soon be normal, of course you need to curtail your athletic activity to a large extent post surgery. Follow a healthy dietary regimen post surgery to improve your general health. Thank you. Take care.",

It is a good idea to take iron supplements. I suggest you take ferrous sulphate 200 mg thrice a day. You can also take vitamin B12 supplements. Vitamin B12 is also involved in the production of Hb. Iron and B12 supplements should be taken for a minimum of 6 weeks. You should also eat foods rich in iron and B12. Foods rich in iron include red meat, spinach, and iron-rich cereals.

Cost is around 1000 rupees. There are two types of typhoid vaccines. One is a v i polysaccharide vaccine which is cheaper one and costs you around 200 to 250 rupees, but the immunity is only about 50 to 60%. The second type is typhoid conjugate vaccine which is costly vaccine around 1800 rupees, but the effectiveness is 99%. I suggest just you go ahead with hepatitis A vaccine and typhoid conjugate vaccine on the same day. Regards -",
        "generated": " Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. Typhoid vaccination is given to those who are at risk of getting infected. So if your child is at risk of getting infected with typhoid then it is advisable to give her the vaccine. Hepatitis A vaccine is also given to those who are at risk of getting infected. So it is also advisable to give your child the vaccine. You can give both vaccines at the same time. If you are worried about the cost of the vaccine then you can consult with your pediatrician for the same. I hope this information will help you. Thank you for using Chat Doctor.

        "expected": "Hello thanks for posting here. A heart rate of 230 on exertion definitely requires evaluation. However first we need to evaluate whether you really reach that 230 reading. While running the heart rate detector may mistake your body vibrations and movements for heart beats and count them accordingly. Hence the heart rate may erroneously show a high reading. So you have to check whether it happens to you only or with everyone. Another thing that can be done is a treadmill test. It requires you to run on a treadmill, the speed of which increases gradually to a point till your heart rate reaches a target rate. This TMT test will continuously record your EKG while you are running so all aberrations and errors can be rules out. It will definitely show whether you really have a fast heart rate on exercising. If it documents very fast heart rate further work up can be done. Wishing you good health. Thank you",
        "generated": " Hi, thank you for writing to us. I have gone through your question in detail and I understand your concern. Your heart rate during exercise is normal. It is normal for the heart rate to increase during exercise. Your heart rate is like a car speedometer. When you are exercising, your heart rate is like a car speedometer. It goes up and down depending on the speed of the car. In your case, your heart rate is going up to 230, which is the speed of the car. The heart rate comes down to a normal rate when you stop exercising, which is like the car coming to a halt. So, you do not have to worry about your heart rate. You can continue your exercise.

Since your doctor is denying any serious illness for your chest pain, no need to worry about major heart or lung related diseases. Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more. So better to follow these steps for symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid movements causing pain. 3. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 4. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these in 5 - 7 days. If not improving in 1 week then get done chest x-ray to rule out internal lung pathology. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

As per your query, I would like to inform you that even pre-ejaculate fluid contains sperm. So, there is a possibility of pregnancy. But, it depends on the amount of pre-ejaculate fluid and the time of ejaculation. If the ejaculation is near the fertile period, there is a higher chance of pregnancy. I would suggest you to get an ultrasound scan done after 15 days of your period to confirm pregnancy. You can also get an urine pregnancy test done. Hope this information helps you.

        "generated": " Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. As per your query, you are concerned about the first time sexual intercourse and the consequences. In males, the first time sexual intercourse is a bit painful and may cause bleeding. This is due to the fact that the penis is not used to this type of movement and may cause micro tears on the penis. The foreskin is attached to the penis by a thin membrane and is not easily detachable. This membrane is usually quite thin and may tear during the first sexual intercourse. This is a normal and harmless phenomenon. The bleeding is due to the micro tears in the penis and may be seen in the semen and on the penis. This is a normal and harmless phenomenon and may not be seen at all times. The first sexual intercourse may be a bit painful due to the movement of the penis and the friction with the vagina. This is a normal phenomenon and will improve with time. Hope this helps. Regards. Chat Doctor. Jay In ChatDoctor. com. c/o Dr. Jay.

Cause of the health problems you queried-There are many causes of the lumps on your right knee after the recent fall. To rule out other causes, I would advise you to consult ER surgeon, who would examine it and treat it accordingly. Still with my expertise and experience, I would suggest you to rule out following causes with your ER OrthoSurgeon. Cause in your case-As the lump is of 2 1/2 weeks duration after review of your query data, it seems to be due to either of the following reasons--Post-traumatic Hematoma with traumatic swelling-which is in process of recovery and may take another 2-3 weeks.-If it doesn't settle after 4-6 weeks, Pre-Patellar Bursitis(Housemaids Knee)-post-traumatic needs to be ruled out. Both above possibilities needs to be ruled as only discomfort is felt by you while walking. In the absence of more information, I would advise Second opinion in your case, who would examine it and investigate it to treat it as per the cause of the lump. So I would advise you to consult ER OrthoSurgeon, who would rule out other causes of such a lump and would help you out with the fist hand information. Do take his Second Opinion, on the above suggestion, as he would advise you with fist hand clinical information. Hope this would resolve your query with full satisfaction.

But better to rule out cardiac cause for your chest pain. So get done ECG first. If ECG is normal then no need to worry much for cardiac cause. GERD appears more in your case. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of burning chest pain. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief.1. Avoid hot and spicy food.2. Avoid stress and anxiety.3. Start proton pump inhibitor.4. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.",

Angina is a condition where the heart muscle is not getting enough oxygen and nutrients to function properly. This is usually due to blockage of the coronary arteries. However, it is important to note that you are only 16 years old and this is a rare age to develop angina. So, I would advise you to get yourself examined by a doctor and get an ECG done. ECG is a non-invasive test that shows the electrical activity of the heart. It is usually done when a person complains of chest pain or other symptoms that are suggestive of a heart problem. If the ECG is normal, then there is no need to worry about a heart problem. However, if it is abnormal, then you may need to get a stress test done. Stress test is a test that is done to see how well your heart is functioning under stress. It is usually done on a treadmill and is a non-invasive test. I hope this information is helpful to you.

These symptoms are related to the job profile. As teachers have to stand longer, teachers have no proper physical health care, always tensions and troubles etc. The reason for the pain in knees are due to early OA changes in the knee joint, and the leg pain is added to the standing for the long run. Pain in the middle finger is the reason due to cervical spine disc nerve root entrapment due to postural changes. I will advise for doing regular exercise which includes the strengthening of the neck muscles, upper limb muscles, inter-scapular muscle, knee muscles, leg muscles, hip muscles, core muscles etc. As these muscles are used in a wrong posture and repetitive stress injury is occurred to the tissues, joints and ligaments. Taking utmost care is important from now as most people ignore these symptoms and when the symptoms boom up it may lead to pain and aches to the maximum.

As you mentioned the mechanism of injury we should understand that when ever there is a fall, there might be two things, either muscular injury or either a bony injury.

Sometimes due to fall there are chances that you may damage the soft tissue of the lumbar spine and also the bony alignments are disturbed. The reason for this is the whole load is borne by the lumbar spine as there is a tremendous thrust on the hip region due to fall.

Treatment with finasteride reduces the risk of being diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer. But there is an increased risk of a later diagnosis of high-grade prostate cancer. Please discuss with your doctor on the probabilities of alopecia intake causing a higher incidence of high grade prostate cancer in later life. At 25 years age you might not have any side effect but with continued intake the risk rises. Instead of taking alopecia you can apply lotion containing a combination of minoxidil and finasteride which works for hair growth. Please do not worry.",

Do not massage or rub the gel too much. Just apply it lightly. After half an hour or so apply a hot water bag/ hot fomentation to the affected area. Do the above at least 3 times a day.

The sliding angioplasty will be fixed with plates and screws to help keep it in place till the healing occurs. Another simpler option if you are only looking at cosmetic augmentation is to go with a Chin augmentation using implants. This would be a simpler option in the sense that there is no bone cutting involved. You can meet your local plastic surgeon to learn more about it. All the best for your procedure. Chat Doctor.

You will be able to eat and drink normally without any problem. It is a minor procedure and you will be able to return to your normal activities within a few days. You should not be worried about the healing process as it is very quick. The procedure is done under local anesthesia and sedation so you will not feel any pain during the procedure.

        "generated": " Hi, Thanks for writing in. Sneezing is a symptom of allergic rhinitis. You need to identify the allergen causing this. Is it dust, pollen, food, or something else? Once you identify the allergen you need to take steps to avoid it. If you cannot avoid it then you need to take medications that can reduce the allergic reaction. There are several medications available like antihistamines, decongestants and corticosteroids. You may need to take a combination of these. You also need to see a doctor to rule out other causes of your symptoms. Hope this helps. Regards.

She can continue this for the next 6 months and then go for an echo study to see if the hole has closed. If it has closed, then she can stop the aspirin.

By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more because your pain is associated with movements. But better to rule out heart and lung related causes first because you are having pigeon chest. So get done ECG to rule out cardiac diseases. Get done chest x-ray to rule out Pulmonary causes. If both these are normal then no need to worry about major diseases. Musculoskeletal pain is more likely in your case. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright.

The strain can be due to the constant jumping and bouncing you did at the park. In addition, the fact that you have a pigeon chest can also contribute to the pain you are experiencing. I would suggest that you get an x-ray done of your chest to rule out any possible fractures. If the x-ray does not show any fractures, I would suggest that you try to take it easy for a few days. Avoid any heavy lifting and bending as this can exacerbate the pain. You can try taking some painkillers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help relieve the pain. If the pain persists, I would suggest that you get a doctor to examine you and diagnose the cause of the pain. Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks for writing in.

The prognosis of liver cancer depends on several factors such as the primary cancer, the extent of the liver cancer and the response to treatment. If the primary cancer is a colon cancer, the prognosis is relatively good as it is possible to cure the primary cancer with surgery and chemotherapy. However, if the primary cancer is from the lungs, the prognosis is poor as the lungs are not easily operable and chemotherapy is not very effective. Radiofrequency ablation is the best treatment for liver cancer and it is most effective if the cancer is limited to one lobe of the liver. It is usually repeated if the cancer recurs.

Your husband's semen analysis is normal, but it is not clear if he has a normal sperm count or normal motility. The motility of the sperm is very important in IVF. If his motility is poor, it may not be ideal for IVF.  In your case, the tube is blocked and the polyp is in the posterior wall of the uterus. You may need to undergo surgery to remove the polyp. It is good that you have a normal right tube. You may want to get a second opinion from another doctor before undergoing IVF.

This should get absorbed of its own in due course. If it does not, or if it increases, I would get you assessed by a general surgeon, who might go for a mammography of bilateral breasts followed by a FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) and possibly a biopsy of the lesion. Further management would depend on the clinical examination and investigation reports. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

The fungi can multiply and cause discoloration of the nail. The discoloration can be yellow, brown, black or green. In your case, I would suggest getting a fungal infection to be ruled out. I would recommend a fungal infection to be ruled out by a podiatrist. A fungal infection can be treated with topical antifungal medication. The treatment can take a few months to a year or more.

If it is a breast tumor, it is usually not mobile. But if it is a lymph node it can be mobile. If it is a breast tumor, it is usually a benign tumor and not a malignant one. If it is a malignant tumor, you will have other symptoms like itching, redness, burning sensation and fluid discharge from the nipple. But as you are not having any of these symptoms, it is more likely that it is a benign tumor. So you need to consult a doctor and get an ultrasound done of the breast and if needed a mammogram.

Topiramate (Topirol) is primarily used to prevent seizures and migraines, but it is also used for depression. It is thought to work by reducing the amount of certain chemicals in the brain that can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety. Tryptophan (Trypamer) is an amino acid that is used as a precursor for the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is involved in mood regulation. It is used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. These medications are commonly used in combination to treat depression. The side effects of these medications are usually mild and include dizziness, drowsiness, and changes in appetite or weight. If your friend is experiencing these side effects, she may want to speak with her doctor about switching to a different antidepressant. Thank you for using Chat Doctor.

Your dentist should have maintained it properly.  If you are worried, you can ask your dentist to take an x-ray and check for any infection.

        "expected": "Hi, Thanks for contacting Chat Doctor. In cases like yours with an ankle sprain and then continued pain, it is most likely that there was some soft tissue damage on the structures that support the ankle joint itself. There is a ligament and two tendons on the outside of the ankle that are the main stabilizers, and these structures can get stretched, partially torn, or completely torn with a sprain. Most times, these will scar back down and continue to support the ankle. Other times, they will not be able to do the job as they did before and will have to work \\\"overtime\\\" to do the same job. This area then gets inflamed and painful, especially after a full day of trying to stabilize the joint (being on the feet all day). It is wise to start out with an ankle brace and see if that helps the area, as the brace can do the job of these soft tissue structures and give them a break to help decrease inflammation/pain. I hope this answer helped, if you have any further questions, I am here to help. Thank you.",

Studies have shown that use of hormones during early stages of pregnancy can harm the fetus if it happens during the stage of organ differentiation, which happens at about 45 days of gestation, or 6 weeks gestation. Any hormone intake prior to this stage, as most often happens unknowingly, has not shown to be harmful. Thus, you are mostly safe since you took the medication very early in your pregnancy and that too, for a smaller period only. Yet, you should test for any possible fetal anomalies and the earliest way available is fetal DNA sampling. Hope this helps.",

This pain is usually accompanied by nausea and vomiting. If you are having such symptoms, it is best to go to the emergency room and get an ultrasound done of the kidneys. If the stone is small and is passing out, you can try to pass it out by drinking a lot of water. If it is large, you will need to go to the emergency room and get a CT scan done to determine the size and position of the stone. You will then be given pain medication and antibiotics. If the stone is not passing out, you will need to have surgery to remove it. Hope this helps you. Best wishes, Chat Doctor..P.S. If you have any more queries, please do not hesitate to write to me.

It can be due to various reasons like allergy, infection, skin problems like eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, or even certain systemic diseases like liver or kidney disease. The best treatment is to identify the cause of the itching and treat it accordingly. For example, if it is due to an allergy then you will need to avoid the allergen and use antihistamines. If it is due to eczema, then you will need to use topical steroids and moisturizers. If it is due to liver or kidney disease, then you will need to treat the underlying disease.

So in the meantime, try not to touch or traumatize them, and as the baby gets larger more may appear. They are simply cosmetic and will cause you no harm or harm to the baby.

As you have mentioned that you have PCOD and have failed to get pregnant 6 times, it is likely that you might have some other factors which are not allowing you to get pregnant.  As you have mentioned that you have lots of sperm in his testis, it is likely that your husband has a low sperm motility or poor sperm morphology.  Also, your husband has a vas deferens blockage which is a very common problem in which the sperm is unable to come out of the penis.  As you have failed to get pregnant 6 times, it is likely that you have a low ovarian reserve.  This can be checked by doing a test called antral follicle count which is done by ultrasound.  If the count is less than 10, then it is likely that you have a low ovarian reserve.  Also, your husband needs to get a semen analysis done to see if he has any other problems.  I would suggest that you get a semen analysis done and antral follicle count done.  If you have a low ovarian reserve, then you should consider using donor eggs.  Hope this helps",

        "generated": " Hello, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Read and understood your concern. Your symptoms of lump in both elbows could be due to various causes. The most common cause is a ganglion cyst, which is a benign tumor. The lump is a fluid-filled sac that is attached to the tendons of your elbow joint. It is usually painless but sometimes may cause pain when it is pressed on nerves. The lump may be moveable or non-moveable. The other causes of lump in elbow joint are lipoma, sarcoma, or any other soft tissue tumors. I would suggest you to consult an orthopedic surgeon and get an X-ray of your elbow joint done. Based on the X-ray findings you may require further tests like MRI or CT scan. The treatment depends on the type of tumor. Hope this helps. Regards Chat Doctor. Ly/2e7a5f4 Regards, Dr. A. K.

        "generated": " Hi, Thanks for writing in. From what you have written, it seems that the symptoms you are experiencing are related to the disc injuries in your spine. The symptoms of pins and needles down the penis could be due to a pinched nerve in the spine. The nerve supply to the penis comes from the sacral plexus of nerves, which is located in the lower part of the spine. When the discs in the spine are injured, they can put pressure on the nerve roots and cause symptoms in the area of the nerve supply. This is called radiculopathy. The symptoms can be treated with physical therapy, pain management and anti-inflammatory medication. You should also avoid heavy lifting, bending and twisting, which can exacerbate the symptoms.

I would like to tell you that the ultrasound abdomen done on your sister shows that she has enlarged liver with heterogeneous parenchyma which is suggestive of fatty liver. The heterogeneous parenchyma of the liver may be due to fatty liver or it can be due to other causes like hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc. The heterogeneous myometrium with bulky uterus and adenomyosis is suggestive of uterine fibroids. The cysts in the right ovary may be due to ovarian cyst. I would advise you to get a CT abdomen done to confirm the diagnosis. If the CT abdomen shows fatty liver then you should consult a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. If the CT abdomen shows cirrhosis of the liver then you should consult a gastroenterologist for further evaluation.

        "generated": " Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is sad to hear that you are facing fertility and erection problems. As per your history, it seems that you are suffering from Varicocele, which is the most common cause of infertility in men. Varicocele is a condition where the veins around the testicles become dilated and enlarged, which affects the blood flow to the testicles and the sperm production. This causes low sperm count, low motility and poor morphology of the sperms. If the varicocele is not treated, it can lead to complete infertility. I suggest you consult a urologist and get a testicular examination done to confirm the diagnosis. A color Doppler ultrasound of the scrotum will confirm the diagnosis of varicocele. You can get the varicocele treated by a procedure called varicocelectomy. This can be done either by an open surgery or a laparoscopic surgery. If the varicocele is not treated, it can lead to complete infertility. I suggest you consult a urologist and get the treatment done as soon as possible. Hope I have answered your query.

        "expected": "Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I totally understand your concern. It is very difficult to give an opinion just by this short story. But I will try to explain you something. It is quite known in cardiology that stent stenosis might happen. This risk is higher during the first 6 months and then decreases. But there are other possibilities after a stent re-stenosis like angioplasty with balloon, stent-intra stent implantation that mean that you might implant a stent into the obstructed stent, always depending on the type of your first stent and the characteristic of the stenosis. And the last option when the other are not possible is by-pass surgery that you all ready know. So, yes...if your three arteries have problems and your stents get stenosis you might end to bypass surgery. If this is technically possible or not depends on the characteristics of your coronary arteries and the positions of stenosis. The risk of bypass surgery depends on your age, your heart function and other organs functions. But you should not worry. You do have possibilities to go quite well. There are a lot of possibilities today with a good chronic medical treatment, angioplasty and by pas' surgery. Wish I was helpful. Best regards.",

You can also consider performing an angiogram to see if the stents are open. Hope this helps. Best wishes! Take care!

The presence of RBC is more concerning as it may indicate the presence of kidney stones. The presence of WBC is also concerning as it may indicate the presence of UTI. The most common cause of UTI is bacterial infection. The most common bacteria causing UTI is E. coli. The symptoms of UTI are burning sensation during urination, frequent urination, pain in the abdomen, lower back pain and pain in the groin. The symptoms are more pronounced in females compared to males. If you have not already done so, I would recommend a urine culture to confirm the diagnosis. You may be prescribed antibiotics based on the results of the culture. If the culture is positive, you would need to take antibiotics for 7-10 days.

        "expected": "Hello, Sorry to hear about the list of injuries you faced. Coming to the point, you mentioned that MRI is suggestive of Lumbar and cervical disc degenerative changes. Let's discuss this first and then the rest. What my experience taught me over a period of 12 years with cases related to injuries like you and others I will give my suggestion. First foremost, buy a soft neck collar and start using it. This will stabilize the bones of the cervical region and also will act as s support to the muscular system to allow less compression over the nerve. The disc injuries are most times self-healing, once the inflammation subsides you should not feel much pain. When using neck collar I will advise you to use on/off hot water fermentation so that the muscled which have undergone spasm will relax, and the pain will come down slowly. Along with this. You have lumbar disc degenerative changes, so why don't you first take hot water fermentation so that the muscles of the lumbar region gets relaxed and make you at least stable. Post this use 3-4 pillows and try McKenzie maneuver in passive way. The details of McKenzie you can find over the net. This will help centralize the pain and once the pain is centralized you can use hot water bag to again soothe the nerve roots. Once nerve root is relaxed the pain travelling in its course will reduce automatically. Post which after 5-7 days of doing this you can focus on exercises, but please continue the above advice as well. Exercise should focus on core stability, lower limb strengthening, upper limb strengthening and neck muscle strengthening. Slowly you will develop strength also and the inflammation on the nerve root will be reduced leading to the end result of improved lifestyle. If your pain symptoms are too high then a nerve block may be administered to the nerve root which may block the pain sensation for a couple of months. But if the muscles remain week still, it will again come back so doing the above-mentioned exercise will be of help to avoid recurrence of pain symptoms. Coming to the surgical management, there is possibility of removal of the torn disc element and also fusing the spine, but this may not make you get rid of the pain over all for long. The pain will be present throughout the life and need exercise for the same. This option I do not recommend unless and until the motor functions are compromised. Also, very important is the diet, what you eat is to be focused. Having food which can digest faster without leading to any gastritis should be kept in mind. As with gastritis there may be leading to two symptoms, one compression over the nerve in the lower spine and headache. Having a good diet plan will be good. Please do not ignore the hip and knee muscles as you have the replacement done in the past and the muscles are weak this may aggravate the spine curvature to deviate and lead to other symptoms. Coming to your ankle, I cannot comment much as the history is too brief to guide over anything. I am sorry for it. Please contact a local physical therapist who can show interest in you and give the maximum output. I have tried my best to put forth the best possible treatment plan which should help you. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.",

Tonsililitis chronic is an infection and oval shaped swelling of the lymph gland tissue located on both sides on the back of the throat caused because of the bacterial or viral infection. Presence of infection in the teeth and the tonsils are usually because of the same bacterial flora but the possibility of transfer from the teeth to the tonsils is very much less.

The tonsils are part of the immune system and are not directly related to the teeth. However, the body can sometimes react to a dental infection by producing a lot of mucus in the back of the throat which can cause tonsillitis. Also, if you have a fever due to a dental infection, the body may also react to this fever by producing a lot of mucus in the back of the throat and cause tonsillitis. If your dentist has told you that you have a dental infection, I would recommend that you get it treated first and then see a doctor to treat your tonsillitis. I hope this helps.

There are multiple causes of paresthesia, including neurological, vitamin deficiencies and even psychological. If you have seen many physicians already, I assume you had blood tests to check thyroid, B12 level, calcium level, magnesium level, iron level, as well as kidney and liver functions.  Some liver and kidney conditions could cause paresthesia. Also, some autoimmune diseases cause similar symptoms such as lupus or polymyalgia rheumatic. Next is to get electromyelograms with nerve conducting velocities of your arms or legs.  This will help identify any problem with your nerves or muscles. Some types of naturopathies cause parasomnias.  Do you have any medical conditions or are you on any medications that could cause these symptoms? The causes as you can see are varied. You can also see a pain management specialist who can help with the paresthesia. I hope you feel better",

First, it would be helpful to know your age and your medical history. Pregnancy must be always excluded, but it can also be some kind of missed or early abortion that causes vaginal bleeding. Pain that you are describing seems like position-dependent pain, and it can be signed of serious abdominal infection (including pelvic infection) such as intra-abdominal or tuboovarian abscesses. The most common vaginal bleeding is benign, and it is called dysfunctional uterine bleeding, but without more information I cannot give you the right answer. I should know does it bleed after intercourse, during menstruation or all the time? Shoulder pain is usually referred pain from other place like abdominal cavity (for example abdominal infection as I've mentioned before) and also you can feel it associated with abdominal discomfort(especially when you're feeling bloated because bloated stomach makes pressure on Phoenix nerve).  My opinion is that there is high possibility that you suffer from endometriosis... So I advise you to do this",

In stage 3, the kidneys are still functioning, but the kidneys are not able to function at the level they should. Stage 3 can be reversed, but it will require a lot of effort and lifestyle changes. These lifestyle changes include a low sodium diet, low protein diet, low fat diet, and a high fiber diet. You will also need to avoid foods that are high in oxalate, phosphate, and potassium. You will need to also avoid foods that are high in salt. You will also need to drink a lot of water and other low sodium fluids.

        "generated": " Hi, thanks for writing in. From your symptoms, it seems like you have bronchitis and not asthma. Bronchitis is an infection of the lungs and is usually viral in nature. It is usually self-limiting, meaning that it will resolve on its own, but there are some things you can do to make yourself feel better. First, make sure you are getting enough rest. Viral infections like bronchitis are usually contagious and can spread through contact with an infected person. Second, make sure you are drinking enough fluids. This will help thin out the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up. You can also use a humidifier in your house to help keep the air moist. Third, make sure you are taking your medications as prescribed. You can also take over-the-counter cough medicine to help relieve your symptoms. I hope this helps.

So, he may have developed microvascular disease of coronary arteries. In such cases, angioplasty is better than open heart surgery. Angioplasty is less invasive and less traumatic surgery. It can be done under local anesthesia. It is less expensive than open heart surgery. Cost of angioplasty in India is around 2-3 lakhs. Open heart surgery cost around 4-5 lakhs. So, angioplasty is better option for your father. Get done stress test (TMT) and echocardiography to see the functional status of heart. If both are normal, angioplasty is better option. If TMT is abnormal and echocardiography shows poor left ventricular function, open heart surgery is better option. Consult cardiologist and get done all tests. Hope I have solved your query.

Your hepatic ducts are within normal size, and the range can be anywhere from 2\\u00a0mm to 7\\u00a0mm, depending on your age and liver function. I wouldn't worry about this.

Lymph nodes are responsible for trapping bacteria and other foreign substances in the body. But if these nodes are enlarged it may cause swelling and pain. It may be due to infection in the body like tonsillitis, sinusitis, or some other infections. It may be due to cancer as well. But it is not due to blood in the tissue as it is not related to lymph nodes. So you need to consult doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment. Doctor will examine you and will ask for some tests like blood test, X-ray of neck, CT scan, biopsy of the lump etc. Doctor will diagnose you based on these tests and will treat you accordingly.

Post Lyme disease syndrome is a condition which occurs after Lyme disease, and symptoms are chronic fatigue, joint pain, muscle pain, headache, cognitive impairment, sleep disorder, memory disorder etc. But it is not confirmed by any specific diagnostic test. So diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is symptomatic. You should consult neurologist and get done detailed neurological examination and investigations like MRI brain, EMG, NCS, etc. If all these are normal then you may be having post Lyme disease syndrome. If you are suspected of post Lyme disease syndrome then you should get done Lyme ELISA and Western blot test. But this test is not 100% accurate. So diagnosis is clinical.

Masturbation is one of the safest way of getting pleasure of sexual satisfaction without having intercourse with female partner, and it is natural and normal for a man to practice it at the young age.First there is myth in a mind of common man that excessive masturbation is the reason of all sexual problems But I would like to state that it has been discussed in scientific forums all over the world and proved scientifically that masturbation does not have any negative effect on any organ or system in the body. Do not worry if you make it a point not to get in to habitual and frequent masturbation there is no reason why you should not father a child after marriage. Chat Doctor.",

When thyroid hormone is low, metabolism is low. So you are gaining weight. Your thyroid hormone level is normal now. So you need not worry about thyroid hormone level. But if you are not able to lose weight, then you need to consult your doctor and get checked for other factors like hypogonadism (low sex hormone), hypogonadism, Cushing's syndrome, etc. These conditions are known to cause weight gain and obesity. You can try following lifestyle modifications to reduce weight. 1. Take low calorie diet. 2. Avoid junk food. 3. Take more fruits and vegetables. 4. Take more protein. 5. Take more fiber. 6. Exercise regularly. 7. Take more water. 8. Avoid stress. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Thanks. Chat Doctor.

Safe period is that part of the menstrual cycle where there is no chance of pregnancy even with unprotected sex. But anyway as you have taken pill the chance of pregnancy is rare. And the pill causes hormonal imbalance leading to effect on timing and bleeding of the period. It might also cause irregular bleeding. So the bleeding might be due to pill effect. So relax. If the period doesntoccur even after 10-15 of expected period then do a urine pregnancy test and consult gynecologist. Over all the chances of pregnancy are very rare. Best regards...",
        "generated": " Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. As you have had unprotected sex on the 8th day of her cycle and she has taken the morning after pill the next day, she is less likely to be pregnant. The morning after pill is 98% effective if taken within 72 hours of having unprotected sex. So you need not worry about pregnancy. But if she is having any symptoms of pregnancy like morning sickness, frequent urination, breast tenderness, etc. then you can go for urine pregnancy test. If the test is positive then you can go for ultrasound at 2 weeks to confirm the pregnancy. I hope this helps you. Let me know if you have any other query. Thank you. Chat Doctor. V. Subrahmanyam.

This is due to the procedure itself and will subside in 2-3 weeks. If this persists, then I would like to know what is the nature of burning sensation? Is it sharp or dull? Is it constant or intermittent? Is it associated with any other symptoms like pain or numbness? If so, then I would like to know the location of pain? I would like to know your age and sex also. In my opinion, you should consult your gastroenterologist and get evaluated. He may ask you to get some investigations done like CT scan of chest and abdomen.

Cysts are fluid filled sacs which can be found in the soft tissues and are common. They are usually painless and are found in the soft tissues. They can be easily removed by surgical excision. Tumors are abnormal growths of cells. They can be benign or malignant. Malignant tumors are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body. Benign tumors are non-cancerous and do not spread. They can be treated with surgery and radiation therapy. I would recommend consulting a doctor for a physical examination and a biopsy to determine what the bump is. Hope this helps.

Are you having any history of trauma or injury to your back? As per your X-ray findings, it seems that your spine is straightened which is due to muscle spasm. You are already on cyclobenzaprine which is a muscle relaxant. So, I would like to know if your pain is getting relieved with the medicine. If yes then it is due to muscle spasm and it will be cured soon. If not then I would like to know your occupation and your lifestyle. If you are having sedentary job and lifestyle then it can be due to muscle strain and exercises can help you to relieve it. If not then I would like to know more about your X-ray findings. If it is a congenital condition then you need to do exercises to strengthen your back muscles and avoid heavy lifting. If it is due to injury then you need to rest and avoid heavy lifting. If you are still having pain then I would suggest you to get MRI of your spine. I would suggest you to consult orthopedic surgeon for proper evaluation and treatment. Hope this helps you.

If the cyst is growing, it is better to remove it. The treatment of ovarian cysts depends on the size of the cyst. Small cysts that are less than 5 cm can be managed with observation. The cyst is monitored with ultrasound and if it grows, it is removed surgically. Larger cysts are removed surgically. If the cyst is causing symptoms, it is removed surgically. The cyst is removed through a laparoscopic procedure, and the ovary is preserved. The only exception is a large cyst that is causing severe symptoms and is putting pressure on the bladder. In such cases, the ovary is removed. I hope this helps you. If you have any further queries, I would be happy to help.

However, your wife may undergo a physical examination, X-ray of the spine and possibly an MRI to confirm the diagnosis. Sciatica is a symptom that is often related to a compression of the sciatic nerve. The compression can be caused by various things such as a herniated disc, degenerative disc disease, or a tumor. There is no specific medication that can cure sciatica, but there are several things that your wife can do to help alleviate her symptoms. She should avoid heavy lifting, bending, and twisting. She should avoid sitting or standing for long periods of time. She should avoid crossing her legs while sitting. She should avoid sleeping on her side with a pillow between her legs.

Put the cuff about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above your elbow. Wrap the cuff snugly around your arm. The BP reading may not be correct if the cuff is too loose.

        "generated": " Hello, I can understand your concern. The CA 19-9 is a tumor marker for pancreatic cancer. It is not a direct marker of the cancer but rather a marker of the cell turnover. The level of the CA 19-9 can be influenced by various factors such as the presence of other diseases, the use of certain medications and the presence of other cancers. In general, a level of 0-30 is normal, a level of 30-100 is suspicious and a level above 100 is consistent with pancreatic cancer. In your husband the CA 19-9 level is 160, which is consistent with the presence of pancreatic cancer. I would recommend a CT scan of the abdomen to rule out the presence of other cancers. A CT scan of the liver and the lungs should also be done to rule out the presence of liver and lung metastases. I hope that my answer has been helpful.

As you know that stones in bile ducts are usually detected during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. They are usually diagnosed by intra operative Cholangiography. This is done by injecting a radio opaque dye through the cystic duct during surgery. This dye is then X-rayed to see the bile ducts. If any stones are seen they are usually removed. If the stones are not seen during surgery then they are usually removed later by ERCP. ERCP is a procedure where a catheter is inserted through the mouth and guided through the bile ducts. The stones are then broken by a laser and the fragments are removed. I hope this information was helpful. If you have any further queries feel free to contact me. Thank you. Chat Doctor.

A lot more tests might be needed. The first test you did for S. type only indicates you have been infected at some time; it may not be an acute infection. Some things I would consider are strep, pneumonia, malaria, other parasitic infections, HIV, herpes, certain other STDs, tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections. Many bacterial infections require a different antibiotic than Ciprofloxacin. You need to have a good examination, to describe the rash, and get more testing done to see what this could be. Hope this helps.",

I would advise you to take an antibiotic like azithromycin for 3 days. You can take a painkiller like acetaminophen if needed. If the fever does not come down in 3 days then you may need to take a viral fever medicine. Take a multivitamin tablet daily. Hope this helps. Regards. Chat Doctor. Ly/2e6xgjg. Ly/2e6xgjg. Regards.

I guess your concern is about...can u have safe pregnancy after an infection and hormonal imbalance post miscarriage.right.my answer is.YES.there are chances of safer pregnancy in the future. Usually after miscarriage it is routine that doctor will advise for ultrasound to conform that whether is miscarriage is COMPLETE (that means all products of conception are expelled out from the womb) or INCOMPLETE (there is retained product of conception inside the womb). In both the cases usually antibiotics are prescribed to prevent infection and incomplete miscarriage usually required minor surgery for removal of retained products so that chances of infection further decreases. As u told that u had miscarriage in last year, but u didn't give whether it was complete or incomplete. U had taken antibiotics or not. So it is difficult for me to comment on this. After miscarriage there is hormonal imbalance usually happens, but in most of the cases it will correct spontaneously. Some women required medication for correlation of it. This hormonal imbalance usually effects the menses, due to that menses will be irregular.u told that u have hormonal imbalance but didn't give info regarding your menses whether it is regular or irregular. So it is difficult for me to comment on this.u also told that u have taking separate which cause pain in your abs, for that u can take alternative medicine after discussing with your treating doctor.

If your infection had resolved n u have regular menses then there is DOUBLE CHANCE of getting pregnant in your case.3. If u r in hurry then visit nearby infertility specialist. He/she can help u.

A heart attack is often described as a feeling of tightness or heaviness in the chest, radiating to the left arm or jaw. This is often accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting.  The symptoms you described are more consistent with a panic attack.  Panic attacks are often triggered by stress, anxiety, and fear. They can be accompanied by a feeling of dizziness, nausea, and lightheadedness.  If you are experiencing panic attacks, you may want to consider talking to a therapist about your symptoms. In the meantime, you can try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization to help you relax.  Hope this helps!

The duration can be decided based on your physician decision and your symptoms. Now coming to your symptoms, leg cramps and sciatica. These symptoms are most probably due to compression and collapse of vertebrae, collection of pus in spinal canal and compression of nerves. To get relief, you should-Avoid any kind of weight-bearing- Avoid flexion and extension at spine-Wear back supporting belt like thoracolumbar corset.- For pain relief, you can take tablet pregabalin after proper prescription. Usual adult is 75 to 150 mg twice a day. If still no relief, you can take tablet amitriptyline after proper prescription.- For cramps, do physiotherapy and take tablet baclofen after proper prescription.- Also increase your protein and calcium intake for strengthening bones. If still no relief and symptoms worsen, repeat MRI spine to rule out any progressively increasing compression of spinal cord or nerves. Sometimes surgery (less than 10% cases) may be needed to relieve pressure symptoms. Hope it will help you. If still in doubt, do let me know. Thanks. Take care. Chat Doctor.",

        "generated": " Hi, thanks for asking at Chat Doctor. The warts are caused by the virus and are not related to HIV. The warts are caused by the virus that is transmitted by contact with the infected skin. So you should keep the warts away from the other skin areas. The warts are not harmful and are not a sign of the HIV infection. The warts can be removed by a dermatologist by the application of the chemical substance that destroys the virus. But it is a long process and it is not very effective. The warts can also be removed by the freezing method. It is also not very effective and is painful. The warts can also be removed by the surgical method. It is also painful and is not very effective. The best method is the application of the liquid nitrogen on the warts. It is a painless method and is very effective. You should apply the liquid nitrogen to the warts 2-3 times per week and the warts will be removed within 2-3 weeks. You should also keep the warts away from the other skin areas. Hope this will help. Regards. Chat Doctor. Lykakis Georgios MD, PhD. Dermatologist. Athens, Greece. Lykakis Georgios MD,",

A bulging disc is a disc that is bulging out beyond its normal space, but has not yet herniated. A torn disc is a disc that has been torn or broken. This is usually due to the disc material being pushed out and then being retracted back into the disc space. You have a bulging disc and a herniated disc at the L4/5 level and a bulging disc at the L5/S1 level. You may have symptoms such as pain in the back and leg, numbness or tingling in the leg, weakness in the leg, and loss of reflexes in the leg. The treatment is usually physical therapy and pain management. If the symptoms are severe, then a discogram can be done to determine if the disc is the source of the pain. If it is, then a disc surgery can be done. In some cases, a spinal fusion may be necessary to stabilize the spine. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you.

It can be caused by many things such as parasitic infections, allergic reactions, asthma, etc. The symptoms you mentioned such as acting strange, forgetting things, dizziness, nausea, pain in different spots, chest pain, etc. are not specific to eosinophilia. If your father has these symptoms and they are not related to any known medical condition, I would recommend a thorough physical examination and some laboratory tests such as complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function tests, urinalysis, etc. If the results of these tests are normal, I would recommend a thorough allergy test to rule out allergic reaction as the cause of the symptoms.

You have mentioned that you are taking medicine - M2 tone for regularization of menses. The dose and since when you have started taking the medicine is not shared by you. After taking the medicines whether the menses have become regular or not, it is also not shared by you. It is natures rule, as we get older the functions of our body will be decreased quantitatively and qualitatively. The ovaries also decrease in its function as women become old. The reproductive age group, that is maximum chances of conceiving is more usually at 20 to 40 years.  Around the age of 50 to 52 years, women stop her menses. This indicates she can't conceive anymore. The age 45-48 years is a transition zone from highly reproductive age group to the age group where menses stop. And here the chances of getting pregnant are not as high as reproductive age group and not low as 50- 52 yrs of age. But still there are a chances of getting pregnant in this transition age, and you are at 42, so there is a hope of getting pregnant. Be positive and don't lose hope. However, irregular menses at this age decreases the chances of pregnancy. But, as you are on medicine for irregular menses, once the menses becomes regular, the chances of getting pregnancy increases. So there is double positive hope for you. Some people thought they are in reproductive age group, because of problem, either in husband and wife, chances of getting pregnancy decreases. You have told that MY AND MY HUSBAND REPORTS ARE FINE. So there is triple positive hope. As you have lost your first child, and you are at the transition zone, it's better to go for an accelerated method of pregnancy. The accelerated methods are-IVF, GIFT, GIFT, CSI. The advantage of accelerated methods is getting twins of triplets is also there. My suggestions",
        "generated": " Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. I read your query and understand your concern. You have had a previous loss of pregnancy, which is a significant factor in your inability to conceive. In my opinion you should have a thorough evaluation by a reproductive endocrinologist. She will evaluate your hormonal levels and look for any underlying causes of your inability to conceive. You may need to have some tests and then start treatment. You may need to take folic acid supplements, and have your husband get a semen analysis. You may also need to have your uterus evaluated by an ultrasound. If you are having any issues with your uterus, you may need to have a D and C. If you are not having any issues with your uterus, you may be able to conceive naturally.

This lump could be due to varicose vein or it could be due to a small benign tumor. If this lump is painful then it could be due to varicose vein, and if it is painless then it could be due to a benign tumor. I suggest you to consult a surgeon and get a clinical examination of the lump. If the lump is not painful and is painless then it is not a varicose vein. The lump could be a benign tumor or it could be a lipoma. A lipoma is a benign tumor which is soft to touch and is painless. If the lump is a lipoma then it can be excised and the patient can be relieved of the lump. I hope this answer helps you. Regards. Chat Doctor. V. Subrahmanyam. MD.  General Surgeon.  India.

Lower back pain can be due to various causes like muscle strain, nerve root compression, disc prolapse, and osteoporosis. If you are a smoker or a diabetic, you should consider the possibility of spinal disc prolapse as a cause for your pain. I suggest you to consult a neurosurgeon for proper diagnosis and treatment. He will do some tests like MRI and X-ray to confirm the diagnosis and then advise treatment accordingly.

Usually this dose is given 36 hours after the follicle reaches 18-20 mm in size. In your case the follicle is 21.6 mm, so I would suggest waiting for 36 hours and then taking another ultrasound to check the follicle size. If the follicle has not ruptured then take another 5000 IU of HCG and wait for another 36 hours. If the follicle ruptures then you can have intercourse. You need to take progesterone supplements for 6 days after the rupture of the follicle and have a pregnancy test 15 days after the rupture. If the test is positive then you are pregnant. If the test is negative then you can take another course of HCG and try to get pregnant again. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions. Kind regards. Chat Doctor.  J. V.

Mermum is a combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid. It is usually used for the treatment of pneumonia, sinusitis and otitis media. It is not effective against E-coli. So it is not effective for the treatment of your UTI. You can continue your treatment with Mermum for other symptoms. If you have frequent UTI, you should get your urine culture done and treat according to the results. If you have frequent UTI and if you are a female, you should get your urethral meatus cleaned with antiseptic solution after each use of toilet. Also, you should wear loose and cotton underwear. Avoid hot and spicy foods. Avoid using scented soaps and creams. You should also get your kidney function checked regularly. If you have any doubt you can ask your doctor. Thanks. Chat Doctor. V.

Hematoma - This is a collection of blood that is seen in the soft tissue. It is usually seen in the groin or buttock area.2.

Trauma - This could be a bruise that has developed in the area.5. Tumor - This could be a benign or malignant tumor that has developed in the area. To rule out these possibilities, you should visit a dermatologist or an orthopedic surgeon and get a physical examination done. You may need to get an X-ray or an MRI done to confirm the diagnosis.

The endometrium is shed during the periods in women of the reproductive age group. At your age, it is important to get an endometrial biopsy if your gynecologist has advised one. Hormonal changes can cause vaginal bleeding in elderly women but if you had a continuous bleeding for 5 to 7 days then it is a concern for endometrial polyp or cancer. Since no large polyp is seen, it can also be that the endometrium is altered due to many reasons. Early stages of cancer cannot be seen on ultrasound. I suggest you also get an MRI scan of your pelvis with the recommendation of your doctor and then do endometrial biopsy. If the biopsy results are negative for malignancy then benign causes must be thought of. If the bleeding repeats frequently then you might require a surgery. There is no home remedy to prevent endometrial cancer. Please do not worry.",

This is usually seen in the neck and axilla. The diagnosis of TB adenitis is based on the presence of TB on a sputum sample, or a positive TB skin test. Treatment for TB adenitis is with antituberculous medications. The lymph node should not have regressed after 2 months of treatment. If the lymph node is not regressing, you should consult a doctor to re-evaluate the diagnosis. You should also get a CT scan of the neck to see if there is any other pathology. If the lymph node is not regressing, it could be due to lymphoma or other infections. You should also get a fine needle aspiration biopsy of the lymph node to confirm the diagnosis. This will help in further management of your condition. Hope this helps. Thanks. Take care. Wish you the best of health. Chat Doctor. Com/tb-adenitis/ Chat Doctor.

It is also seen in people who have diabetes. In some people it can be caused by certain medications. The medication that your wife is taking is an estrogen receptor antagonist. This medication is used to treat breast cancer and is usually given for 5-10 years. The side effects of this medication are usually mild and include hot flashes, weight gain, muscle weakness, joint pain, etc. Fatty liver is not a common side effect of this medication.

        "generated": " Hi, Thank you for writing to us. I have read your query and I can understand your concern. Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella Typhi. The infection is systemic and it can cause fever, chills, headache, joint pain and swelling of the legs. The joint pain and swelling is due to the inflammation of the synovial membrane. The synovial membrane is the lining of the joint and it produces the synovial fluid which is the lubricant of the joint. In typhoid fever, the synovial membrane is inflamed and it produces an excess of the synovial fluid which leads to swelling of the joint. The knee is commonly involved and the symptoms are usually bilateral. The treatment of typhoid fever is with antibiotics. The fever should be brought under control with antipyretic medicines like paracetamol. The joint pain can be controlled with analgesic medicines like ibuprofen or diclofenac. I hope this helps.

        "generated": " Hi, thank you for consulting Chat Doctor. I read your query and understand your concern. I am a nephrologist, and I have dealt with many patients with diabetes. From your query, it seems that you are having episodes of dizziness, blurred vision and fatigue after exercises. You are having high blood sugar levels during the episodes, but not when you are fasting. This is consistent with a diagnosis of stress hyperglycemia, which is a type of diabetes. It is not the same as type 1 diabetes, which is a chronic autoimmune disease. The high blood sugar levels during the episodes are a result of the increased glucose production by the liver in response to stress. The liver is producing glucose at a rate that is higher than the rate at which the body can use it. This leads to high blood sugar levels. The high blood sugar levels can cause damage to the blood vessels, which can lead to damage to the kidneys and eyes. It is important to control the blood sugar levels and prevent the development of complications. I hope this helps you. Let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you for using Chat Doctor.

So, I would suggest you to practice Kegel exercises, which are helpful in strengthening the muscles of the vagina. Also, you can use a vaginal dilator, which is a device that is inserted into the vagina to help it get used to the idea of being stretched and relaxed.

These include stress, thyroid disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome, anovulation, etc. If you are trying to get pregnant, then you can try for a few more days. If you do not have your period, then you can get a pregnancy test done. If it is positive, then you need to visit a doctor for prenatal check-up. If it is negative, then you can try for a few more days. If you are not trying to get pregnant, then you can take a progesterone pill for a few days to induce your period. You can also take a combined oral contraceptive pill for a few days to induce your period. Hope this helps you. Thank you. Take care. Chat Doctor. V.

        "generated": " Hi, Thanks for writing in. Based on your father's age and the fact that he is not eating much and is getting weaker, I think he may have liver cirrhosis. This is a condition where the liver becomes scarred and loses its function. It is often caused by chronic alcohol abuse, but it can also be caused by other diseases. In the later stages of the disease, the liver is not able to filter the blood properly and this leads to swelling of the feet and legs, and also leads to a loss of appetite and weight. I would advise your father to see a doctor as soon as possible and get a blood test to check his liver function. The doctor will also need to take a history of his drinking habits and other medical conditions. Depending on the results, the doctor may recommend further tests and treatment. I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions. Regards, Chat Doctor.  If you are satisfied with my response, please leave a feedback so that I can improve my future answers. Thanks and Regards.

These medicines can help prevent the hepatitis C virus from damaging your liver. Sometimes treatment doesn't permanently lower the amount of virus in your blood. But some studies have shown that treatment may still reduce scarring in your liver, which can lower your chances of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer. Further medicines to treat hepatitis C don't work for everyone. Chronic hepatitis C infection is cured or controlled in about half of the people who are treated with a combination of peg interferon and Riboviria. I suggest you discuss this with a gastroenterologist (specialist in liver diseases) and then your doctor will decide what is good for you depending on further testing. Thank you.",

They include, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, headache, dizziness, breast tenderness, change in weight and mood changes. These side effects usually disappear after a few weeks of taking the pills. Micro pills can cause weight gain in some women. However, this is usually due to water retention rather than fat gain.

The good news is, if detected in early stage, it can be completely cured with the right choice of antibiotic. I would prefer to start you on antibiotics like amoxyclav and azithromycin to start with, which generally work well for community acquired pneumonia.  Before the first dose of antibiotic, I would suggest you send a sample of your early morning phlegm for gram stain and culture sensitivity (the test that detects which organism has caused your phlegm to get infected and also tells which antibiotic will work to kill that organism). As far as your pain is concerned, it seems to be a musculoskeletal pain. The pounding heart is also mostly likely due to the pain. So taking analgesics, hot compress and physiotherapy should help. Do consult a physician in person for a complete check-up and evaluation.  Hope my reply was of help.  Do Chat Doctor.  Thanks.",

All these factors can cause the symptoms you are experiencing now. I would like to know if you have had a recent chest X-ray? And do you have a recent ECG done? These will help us understand the situation better. If you have any other symptoms like shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing, then I would advise you to see your doctor again.

        "generated": " Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Based on your history, it is unlikely that you would have got pregnant. As your husband did not ejaculate inside you, there is no sperm inside your body. The chances of pregnancy in such a situation are less than 1%. Even if there is a small amount of semen that touches the cervix, it is not enough to cause pregnancy. This is because the sperm are destroyed by the acidic environment of the cervix and the uterus. The chances of pregnancy are more if the semen is deposited close to the cervix and enters the cervical canal. This is known as cervical mucus penetration. In your case, you were bleeding during the period and this would have prevented the sperm from entering the cervical canal. Even if the sperm were able to enter the cervical canal, the chances of pregnancy are less than 5% in such a situation. I hope this information helps you.

These are benign lesions and usually don't cause any symptoms. But sometimes they can become infected and cause symptoms. Since she is 57 years old, I don't think it is an acne. But if it is an acne, then it can also be treated with antibiotics like doxycycline or minocycline. But in case of sebaceous cyst, antibiotics won't work. You should get a biopsy of the lesion to confirm the diagnosis. If it is sebaceous cyst then it needs to be surgically removed. Till then, you can give her warm compresses on the affected area and give her antihistamines like loratadine or cetirizine to relieve her symptoms. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks. Chat Doctor. D. V. S. Raju. MD.

But in your case, since you had unprotected sex two months back, you should go for pregnancy test first. If the pregnancy test is negative, then you should consult a doctor for further evaluation. You may need to go for an ultrasound of the abdomen. You should also get a pelvic exam done. If you have a lump in the pelvic region, it is most likely a cyst or a tumor. If it is a cyst, it can be removed surgically. But if it is a tumor, you should consult an oncologist for further management. If the lump is not painful, and not growing, you can wait for a few weeks for it to resolve on its own. But if it is painful and growing, you should consult a doctor for further evaluation.

        "generated": " Hello, Hepatitis A is a type of viral hepatitis. It is caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV) and is spread through the fecal-oral route. It is most commonly spread through contaminated food and water. The symptoms of hepatitis A can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, pale stools, and yellowing of the skin and eyes. These symptoms usually start within 2 to 6 weeks after being infected and can last for 1 to 3 months. Treatment for hepatitis A is usually supportive, meaning it focuses on relieving the symptoms and helping the body recover. This can include rest, a healthy diet, and avoiding alcohol. In severe cases of hepatitis A, hospitalization may be necessary to receive IV fluids and other treatments. Hepatitis A is not contagious and is not spread through person to person contact. The best way to prevent hepatitis A is to get vaccinated. The hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for people who are at high risk for the disease, such as those who travel to areas where hepatitis A is common, people who have a weakened immune system, and people who have a history of hepatitis A infection. I hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions.",

Your symptoms like skipping of heart beats during exercise and not during rest, and improvement of symptoms after stopping exercise, suggests that your arrhythmia is related to exercise. So it is not serious. You need to do stress test to rule out serious arrhythmias. You can take beta blockers if you are having symptoms of arrhythmia.

At times, features of a disease on an X-ray and CT scan is not characteristic and obvious to the eyes years before it manifests in to a disease that could be hurting. I guess unfortunately such an incident has occurred with you. The dark spot which you questioned was probably looking more normal and acceptable on the X-ray and CT scan earlier. Many doctors choose to follow up such findings and this is subjective. Therefore, any such normal findings might be passed as harmless. The patient is usually cautioned to follow up with the doctor. Many medicines are initially discovered for treatment on one disease condition and are later found to help in other conditions. There are clinical trials at multiple levels before a medicine for cancer might be implemented for regular use in patients. The topic about scrubbing before surgery is a time tested practice and confirmed to reduce chances of infection. There are many arguments in medicine and most are sorted out with research and evidence based medicine followed in modern day. Please do not worry.",

Some of them are hormonal imbalance, polycystic ovarian disease, thyroid disorders, etc. You should consult with your gynecologist and get checked for these. If you are sure that your irregular periods are due to hormonal imbalance, then taking hormonal pills is the best way to regularize your periods. These pills are safe if you take them as per your doctor's advice. If you take them for more than 3 months, you may put on weight. So, take them for 3 months and then stop. If your periods are still not regular, then you should consult with your gynecologist again. You can take folic acid supplements to prevent anemia. If you have polycystic ovarian disease, then you should take birth control pills to prevent the development of cysts. You can also try to exercise more and eat healthier. Hope this helps.

        "generated": " Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. From your description, it seems that you have atrial fibrillation (AF). However, you are not sure about this. I would suggest you to consult a cardiologist and get an ECG done. This will confirm whether you have AF or not. Irregular beats in AF are very different from those in normal sinus rhythm. You will be able to see them on the ECG. In addition to ECG, you will also need a 24 hour Holter recording to confirm the diagnosis of AF. You need to take treatment for AF. I would suggest you to take a beta blocker or a calcium channel blocker. These are used to control the rate of your heart. You should also take warfarin. This is an anticoagulant which is used to prevent stroke. In addition to these, you should also make some lifestyle changes. These include stopping smoking, limiting your alcohol intake, taking regular exercise, losing weight if you are overweight, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding stress. I hope this helps.

It is not related to thyroid or depression. It is related to abnormal heart rhythm. It is called atrial fibrillation. It is common in patients with hypertension and diabetes. So first check your blood pressure and blood sugar. If they are abnormal then treat them. Then take an electrocardiogram (ECG) and 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry. It is a benign condition. If you are having symptoms like palpitation, shortness of breath then take an anti-arrhythmic Chat Doctor.  But if you are having no symptoms then no need to take any medicine. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you a very good health. Thanks for using Chat Doctor.

The egg release (ovulation) takes place 14 days prior to next expected menses. So you can calculate the date of your ovulation. The intercourse which is around (plus or minus 4 days) the date of ovulation is responsible for the conception. Since there is difference of about 15-20 days between the two intercourses, ultrasonography can give your approximate date of conception (rather the age of the baby). This also can help you to figure out which intercourse is responsible for this pregnancy. The foolproof evidence you can have about the paternity of this baby is by DNA test. I hope this helps you to resolve your dilemma.",

The viral cause is self-limiting and resolves with time. The bacterial cause is treated with antibiotics. The eye discharge in a child is mostly due to viral cause. So the antibiotics will not help. The viral cause of the eye discharge will resolve with time. So it is best to wait for few days and see if it resolves.

It may be due to traumatic injection given to you during treatment. It can cause injury at the injection site leading to lesion formation and pain. Other reason can be that in case of deeply infected tooth if the filling is done accidentally directly over the tooth nerves and blood vessels present in the central portion of tooth can cause inflammation of pulp and pus formation near the root tips of tooth causing lesion formation and pain. One reason can be that during treatment any instrument got accidentally injured the gums or the filling material got impacted into the gums causing infection. Treatment can be decided only after clinical examination by a dentist to rule out the cause for infection. By the time you can take painkiller like Ibuprofen if u have pain and not allergic. If the cause is due to filling over the nerves' removal of filling followed by root canal treatment and antibiotics can resolve the lesion. If infection is ruled out antibiotics can be helpful. In case of any foreign material impacted in the gums can be treated by scaling... Hope your query is solved. Thanks and regards.",

But one thing should be known that the size of penis does not determine the potency of an individual. So, stop worrying about this. Also do not get influenced by any over the counter medication which claim to increase the size of penis or improve performance...it may be harmful. Having a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts & honey increase blood flow to penis & maintains erection. Avoid stress...practice meditation.this helps in improving concentration & builds up the confidence level. Avoid smoking & alcohol. You can also do oil massage of the penis...it increases blood flow & maintains the erection. Wishing you a Healthy Life. Take care.",

Penis size is not related to its functionality. If your penis is normal in erection, then there is no need to worry about its size. If you are having any problem in erection, then consult urologist for examination and treatment. You can also use vacuum device or penis extender for increasing penis size.

The pain on the left side of your abdomen could be related to your liver and spleen, but it could also be related to other organs in the area. You need to have an ultrasound to evaluate the liver and spleen. You also need to have a CT scan to evaluate the other organs in the area.

If the colonoscopy is normal, then you may need to have an MRI of the abdominal organs to evaluate for any other possible causes of your symptoms.  If you are feeling tired and weak, then you need to have a blood test to see if your hemoglobin is low.  If it is, then you need to take iron supplements.  If you are not feeling tired and weak, then you need to have a blood test to see if your white blood cell count is low.  If it is, then you need to take antibiotics.  I hope this helps.

        "generated": " Hi, Thanks for writing to us. A seroma is a collection of fluid that forms at the site of the surgery. The fluid is usually clear and is a result of the breakdown of the tissue. The seroma usually resolves on its own and does not require any treatment. A hard lump is a different thing. It could be a result of the formation of a scar tissue. The lump could be a result of the formation of a hematoma or a collection of blood. It could also be a result of the formation of an infection or a collection of pus. I would suggest you to get the lump checked by a doctor. You can get a fine needle aspiration or a biopsy of the lump to find out what it is. If it is a hematoma, it should resolve on its own. If it is an infection, you would require antibiotics. If it is a scar tissue, you would require a local steroid injection. If it is a collection of pus, you would require an incision and drainage. Hope this helps. Regards. Chat Doctor.  V. S. Raju.

The swelling is not related to the crown, but rather the root canal. It sounds like your dentist may have prescribed the antibiotic correctly.

The tightness in the chest could be due to the heart disease, but I would like to tell you that the smoking habit is more likely to cause the tightness in the chest than the heart disease. So, I would suggest you to quit smoking immediately. You can take the help of the nicotine replacement therapy or the counseling. You can also take the help of the medicines like the antidepressants if needed. So, I would suggest you to consult the doctor and get the treatment. Hope I have answered your query.

Polycythemia could be due to exposure to high altitude in your fathers case where low oxygenation stimulates erythropoietin production causing increase in RBC count. Many cancers also predispose to polycythemia like liver cancer. Associated conditions along with polycythemia play an important role here.

        "generated": " Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor. I read your question and understand your concern. Polycythemia is a condition where there is an overproduction of red blood cells. This can be caused by a variety of factors. Most of the time it is a benign condition, but in some cases it can be a sign of a serious underlying condition. I am not sure if your father was exposed to Agent Orange, but I can tell you that this is not a cause of polycythemia. In the US there is a program to help veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange. The symptoms of polycythemia can be mild or severe and include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headaches, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dark urine, pale skin, and bleeding gums. Treatment is with phlebotomy and sometimes with medications. If your father had polycythemia, I hope he was getting treatment for it. In my opinion it is unlikely that this is related to Agent Orange exposure. I hope this information is helpful for you. Let me know if you need further assistance. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.

In case you are able to perform extension and flexion of the knee, I think it's a ligament injury, and we ended to take up the MRI to rule out this.

Regarding your concern, I would explain that in a normal person, marijuana can lead to 5 times increased risk of heart attack during the first hour after smoking it.

The conservative measures that might help you are warm baths; ice can relieve the pain of acute thrombosis; high-fiber diet (methylcelulose); stool softener; topical steroids can alleviate symptoms of itching and inflammation; topical nitroglycerin can also reduce symptoms, but it can have side effects like dizziness and hypotension.

They are caused due to increased pressure on the veins in the rectum and anus. The veins in the rectum and anus are very thin and fragile. When there is increased pressure on them, they can get damaged and can cause bleeding. Hemorrhoids can be caused due to many factors such as constipation, diarrhea, pregnancy, lifting heavy weights, sitting for a long time etc. Hemorrhoids can be treated with both medications and lifestyle changes. Medications such as hydrocortisone cream can be applied on the hemorrhoids to reduce the swelling and pain. Hemorrhoids can be treated with lifestyle changes such as avoiding constipation, eating a high fiber diet, avoiding lifting heavy weights, avoiding sitting for a long time etc. If the hemorrhoids are large and painful, they need to be treated with surgical procedures.

Let me help you understand in this scenario the meaning of implantation failure.  When pregnancy test comes negative in two or more IVF cycles where 6 or more reasonably good quality embryos are transferred then it is assumed to be implantation failure which means the embryo has failed to get buried in the soil(which is endometrium). When the embryo is transferred, the endometrium needs to receive it with the help of finger like microscopic structures to help it get buried. And the endometrium can do it only within a very short time frame, usually 6 to 7\\u00a0days post ovulation. Sometimes this timeframe within which it can receive seems to be shifted either early in the cycle or later. By doing an ERA(Endometrium receptivity array) test we are able to predict this timeframe much precisely so that the embryo transfer can be timed accordingly.  2. The size of the uterus doesn't matter for pregnancy unless its tiny. 3. Progynova is not being used for increasing the size of uterus. Hope your question is satisfactorily answered. Good luck.",

Acute sun burns are sometimes frightening but nothing to worry as It's pretty easy to manage.

Apply good moisturizer like Detail every time before going to bed. Antihistaminics and antioxidant tablets can additionally be added. Use high SPF broad spectrum sunscreen every time before going out in sun. Cold sponging will definitely help. Hope this will take care of your issue. Wish you best of health. Thank you Chat Doctor.

It is better to get a CT scan of the sinuses. The antifungal medicines like Amphotericin B, Flucytosine, itraconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole and terbinafine are commonly used for the treatment of the fungal infection. The antifungal medicines should be used for a longer period of time to prevent the recurrence of the infection.

You may also need to get your inner ear checked by an ENT specialist. I hope this helps you. If you have any further query, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you and take care.

Also, you can make sure that he does not catch a cold or flu as this will make his asthma worse. Hope this helps!

The bruising could be due to the reconstruction surgery, or it could be due to a new injury. If you are still having pain in your knee, then it is best to go back to your surgeon for an examination. They can assess the knee and determine the cause of the pain. If the pain is due to the reconstruction surgery, then it will be gradually improving over the next few months. If the pain is due to a new injury, then you may need to have further surgery to fix the knee. If the pain is not due to the reconstruction surgery, then you can start with a few exercises to help reduce the pain. These exercises should include straight leg raises, lunges and squats. These exercises should be done slowly and gently to help reduce the pain. I hope this information was helpful. Please get back if you have any further queries. Thank you. Chat Doctor. P. S.

I would suggest you to take some painkillers like tablet tramadol and tablet diclofenac. You can take tablet cystone and tablet punarnava to clear the stone. You can also take some antispasmodic like tablet nizagara. I would suggest you to take laser treatment for clearing the stone. Laser treatment is a non-invasive treatment and doesn't require any hospital stay. It takes 2 to 3 sessions to clear the stone.

When there is an infection in the body, the lymph nodes enlarge to help fight the infection. The lump may be painless if it is a lymph node. You may need a fine needle aspiration biopsy to determine the cause of the lump. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the lump and a small sample is taken. The sample is then sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope. The results of the biopsy will tell you if the lump is a lymph node or if it is something else.

        "generated": " Hi, thanks for writing in. It is unfortunate that the stent got blocked again, but this is not uncommon. It is good that he did not have any symptoms and the doctors found it on a routine follow-up. There is a medicine called Plavix that is used to prevent the stent from getting blocked again. It is a blood thinner that prevents platelet aggregation. It is a good idea to ask your cardiologist about this. Also, there is no medicine that can remove the blockage, but it can be treated with medications. However, it would be good to know the reason for the blockage. If the blockage is due to a blood clot, then the doctor can give him a blood thinner. But if the blockage is due to the narrowing of the coronary arteries, then the doctor can give him a medicine called a statin. This medicine helps to reduce the cholesterol levels in the blood. If the blockage is due to the plaque in the coronary arteries, then the doctor can give him a medicine called a fibrate. This medicine helps to reduce the plaque in the coronary arteries. It is best to discuss with your cardiologist and get the cause of the blockage diagnosed. Hope this helps. Regards. Chat Doctor. com.",

When it happens, the blood flowing through the vessels from heart to brain might have a reduced flow. These are by the carotid and vertebral arteries on either sides. This is more significant when you are standing upright and doing any moderate to heavy physical activity. You might require a CT scan or MRI scan of the brain. The best way to analyze if the reduced blood flow to the brain is causing your dizziness is by doing a carotid and vertebral arteries Doppler ultrasound. It will show the flow of blood from the heart to the brain and if it is adequate. Clinical examination of inner ear and vestibular system in the ear is also required. It might help to do an Electronystagmography (ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG) done to record abnormal eye movements while the head is placed in different positions or your balance organs are stimulated with water or air. For this you might have to consult the ENT specialist. Dizziness can also occur due to stress related anxiety or overflow of emotions.",

A biopsy is the only way to know for sure what it is. But don't worry, most lumps are benign. You can see a surgeon and get it removed. Hope I have answered your question.

Early on after their insertion, this is very common.  Later, such as after 2 years, the lining of the uterus becomes very thin (which is normal) and prone to bleeding.  This can once again be treated with birth control pills.  This has nothing to do with marijuana use.  Finally, make sure that you check a pregnancy test now and in 1-2 weeks. I hope that this helps and good luck!",

        "generated": " Hi, thanks for writing in. Thumb sucking is a habit that can be difficult to break, but it can be done with proper guidance and management. Femite is a bitter tasting liquid that is applied to the thumb, and this is said to deter the child from sucking the thumb. However, I am not sure about the side effects of this product, and I would recommend consulting with a pediatrician for advice. In the meantime, you can try to distract her from sucking her thumb by giving her a pacifier or a toy, and by keeping her busy with other activities. It may take some time and patience to break this habit, but it can be done. Hope this helps. Best wishes!

In 20% of patients which causes inflammation in the liver and high ALT level, the condition is called NASH.NASH is more dangerous than fatty liver. 20% of patients with NASH will develop cirrhosis of liver. Your condition is NASH. It is a control able condition. The first line management is achieving weight loss by lifestyle n dietary modification. You should avoid junk foods, oily foods and sweets. You should continue combination of capsule ursodeoxycholic acid 250-300 mg once a day and capsule vitamin E 200-400 mg once a day. This combination has shown promising effect in clinical trials. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a safe Chat Doctor.  It has narrow spectrum of side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness and dyspepsia. But most of the patients tolerate it very well. Clinical data has also shown proven role of metformin which you are already taking. You have been prescribed appropriate treatment for your condition (NASH).

So you should consult a neurologist and get examined. You can get an EMG and nerve conduction study done to rule out lip tremors. You can also get a biopsy done to rule out lip cancer. You can also get a lip smear done to rule out lip infection. You can take symptomatic treatment for lip shivering. You can apply topical antibiotic ointment on the lip.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

Angina is chest pain due to inadequate blood supply to heart muscle. It is caused by blockage in coronary arteries. It is more common in obese and diabetic patients. But your weight and height are normal. So need to worry about diabetes. But you are having chest pain. So get done ECG and 2d echo. ECG will show changes in heart muscle and 2d echo will show blockage in coronary arteries. If both are normal then no need to worry about heart disease. But still, you are having pain. So get done stress test (TMT or treadmill test). If test is positive then need to consult cardiologist and get done coronary angiography and angioplasty. If test is negative then no need to worry about heart disease. It might be due to other causes like musculoskeletal pain or gastrointestinal pain. So get done X-ray chest and ultrasound abdomen.

Usually these happen in elderly people, but if there is some abnormality in the vein wall, you are obese, your routine requires you to stand for very long periods of time then younger people like you may suffer from it, too. To get relief from this, you need to wear compression stockings that are available in medical stores. Do lots of exercise. Elevate your legs while sleeping and if possible, when you are sitting. Try to avoid continuous standing periods. If you do not find relief in symptoms or then worsen, you should see a physician for physical examination. I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Best,",

These are usually due to weakness of the valves in the veins. You should consult a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and management.

Such feelings can be due to various causes like spinal cord problem, compression in the spinal cord due to infections or even tumor. The best thing will be to be examined by a neurologist who will assess the exact neurological problem. I mean he will examine the back for any local pain, swelling etc., and he will do a detailed neurological assessment regarding the presence or absence of any neurological deficits. This will help us guide you if you need an MRI scan of the back or not. If both the neurological examination by a neurologist and MRI scan comes as normal, then you may benefit with physiotherapy or else you will have to undergo treatment as per the cause identified by these tests Hope this clarifies",

You should consult a neurologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Meanwhile, you can take a pain reliever like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce this sensation.

        "generated": " Hi, Thanks for writing in. It seems like you are having symptoms of worsening of COPD. The left lung nodule is not causing any problems at the moment, but it is better to get it checked. You should visit a pulmonologist and get a CT scan of the chest. If the nodule is small, then it is likely to be benign, and you should get a follow-up CT scan after a few months to see if it is growing. If the nodule is large, then you should get a biopsy done to find out if it is benign or malignant. The pain in the chest, shoulders and collar bone area is likely to be due to the worsening of COPD. The tingling and stiffness in the arms and neck is likely to be due to the nerve compression. You should avoid smoking and exercise more. Avoid lifting heavy weights and avoid bending and stooping. You can also try to reduce the pain with the help of painkillers. I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions. Thanks and take care. Wish you the best of health.
