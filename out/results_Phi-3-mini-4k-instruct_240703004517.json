The treatment for plantar fasciitis involves stretching the calf area, applying ice, taking several medications such as ibuprofen.  Seeing a physical therapist can also help.  Bone spurs are very common and in themselves do not usually cause pain.  Most of the pain from plantar fasciitis comes from the soft tissues. Sometimes for severe plantar fasciitis I will prescribe a night splint. Surgery is almost never indicated for this condition. As regards the neck issue, it sounds as though this might be soft tissue in origin, particularly if your x-rays are negative.  You could be experiencing mild muscle spasm or a simple strain of the soft tissues in the cervical region.  It might be a good idea to pay a visit to a physical therapist who can teach you some stretches and some exercises to do at home. If your neck feels stiffer than simple applications of heat will help. I hope this information is useful for you. Please do not hesitate to message us back if you have any further questions.

While I understand the concern about the distance to the hospital, the risk of complications from untreated appendicitis is far greater than the inconvenience of transportation.\n\nIn the meantime, keep monitoring the symptoms and encourage your husband to drink plenty of fluids and rest. Avoid giving him any solid foods. If the pain worsens, he experiences vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms, do not hesitate to call emergency services for transportation to the hospital.",

A lot of people have it genetically predetermined, although parents may/may not have it. A frequent cause of non-genetic lip darkening is the use of lipsticks /colored balms/gloss, as these tend to darken the lips over a period of time. So try and not use it too often. If you have to use it, then let it be alleged free and replace them every 2 months. I would advise you to start using medicated lip balms with SPF and to reapply it several times in a day.that helps in reducing further darkening. Definite cream or any others having Comic acid can be used twice a day for lightening of lip color. It usually does not have side effects. However u can check for tolerance of the product by applying it for a short time on the first application. If you have a genetic tendency to dark lips, the pigmentation has chances of coming back after the cream is stopped. U can also opt for mild chemical peels once in 15-30 days to exfoliate better and lighten faster. Take care!",

However, these creams are not commonly recommended for use on lips, as they can cause irritation, dryness, and even more discoloration if not used properly.\n\nIt's essential to consult a dermatologist or a qualified medical professional for advice on treating hyperpigmentation on your lips. They may recommend alternative treatments or prescribe a specific cream formulated for lip use.\n\nTo prevent further darkening of your lips, you can try the following:\n\n1. Avoid licking your lips, as this can cause dryness and lead to more discoloration.\n2. Use a lip balm with SPF to protect your lips from sun damage.\n3. Keep your lips moisturized by using a gentle, fragrance-free lip balm regularly.\n4. Avoid smoking",

As the pain in the knee is persisting a thorough assessment is needed. Due to ligament injuries within the knee joint, such types of pain can be expected. On a longer run, this ligament injuries if left untreated leads to early OA knee, that is the degenerative changes in the knee joint. Also, undergoing an MRI of the knee should help understand the soft tissues better and then you have to undergo physical therapy for 2-3 weeks post which you can follow the exercises at home itself. Any prevention in the early stages provides good results. In my clinical experience, early detection helps in early time and late detection cases responds slowly. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.",

However, they can sometimes be associated with an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities, such as Trisomy 18, Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), or Trisomy 13.\n\n2. Triple marker test: This is a blood test performed during the second trimester (usually between 15-20 weeks gestation) to screen for certain chromosomal abnormalities and neural tube defects.

The positive home pregnancy test (HPT) you mentioned could be due to several factors, such as testing too early, a defective test, or even stress.

Timing: Home pregnancy tests are most accurate when taken after a missed period. If you've only had spotting and no period yet, it's possible to still be pregnant. The faint positive result may be a false positive, or it could indicate very early pregnancy.\n\n2.

These symptoms are related to the job profile. As teachers have to stand longer, teachers have no proper physical health care, always tensions and troubles etc. The reason for the pain in knees are due to early OA changes in the knee joint, and the leg pain is added to the standing for the long run. Pain in the middle finger is the reason due to cervical spine disc nerve root entrapment due to postural changes.

As you mentioned the mechanism of injury we should understand that when ever there is a fall, there might be two things, either muscular injury or either a bony injury.

Sometimes due to fall there are chances that you may damage the soft tissue of the lumbar spine and also the bony alignments are disturbed.

While I'm not a doctor, I can offer some general advice and suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized care.\n\nHere are some general tips and home remedies that may help with warts, but remember that these are not a substitute for professional medical advice:\n\n1. Salicylic acid: You can try using over-the-counter salicylic acid products, which are often used for wart removal. Apply the product as directed, usually by gently peeling away the dead skin layer around the wart.\n\n2. Apple cider vinegar: Some people find that soaking a cotton ball in apple cider vinegar and applying it to the wart for a few hours daily can help dissolve the wart. However, this method can be painful and irritating to the skin, so use caution.\n\n3. Garlic: Applying crushed garlic directly to the wart and covering it with a bandage may help.

The location you mentioned, near the end of the sternum and the area where the last ribs meet, suggests that this mass may be related to the structures in the lower part of the thoracic cavity, such as the diaphragm, liver, spleen, or possibly an enlarged lymph node.\n\nTo better understand the nature of this lump, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional. They will perform a thorough physical examination and may order imaging studies like an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI to determine the cause and nature of the mass.\n\nHere are some possible causes for a palpable abdominal mass in the described location:\n\n1. Enlarged lymph nodes: Lymph nodes may become enlarged due to various reasons, such as infection, inflammation, or malignancy.\n\n2.

Clomid (clomiphene citrate) and Progynova (progesterone) are commonly prescribed medications for couples experiencing difficulty with conception.\n\nClomid works by stimulating ovulation in women who have irregular ovulation patterns or who are not ovulating at all. It can increase the chances of conception by helping to release a mature egg from the ovaries. Progynova is a form of progesterone, which is a hormone that helps prepare the uterine lining for a potential pregnancy after ovulation.\n\nThe success rate of clomid varies depending on factors like the woman's age, the cause of infertility, and the duration of treatment. For women under 35 years old, the success rate is around 10-20% per cycle. For women over 35, the success rate may be slightly lower.\n\nProgynova is typically used during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, which is the time between ovulation and the start of your period",

A lump in the inguinal region can simply be due to inflammation of the lymph nodes over there due to some infection. Spotting is not due to these lumps. Do not neglect your diet. Have regular diets. You see anxiety is an ailment which can be overcome very easily. Try relaxation techniques like consciously breathing in and out twice a day for 5 minutes. It will help you to relax. Every night before going to sleep write out 3 things that went well that day, it can be anything like you read a good story book, or you helped someone in the street, cooked a delicious dish just anything.

In cases like yours with an ankle sprain and then continued pain, it is most likely that there was some soft tissue damage on the structures that support the ankle joint itself.

Here are some treatment options that a doctor might consider:\n\n1. Observation: If the lipomas are not causing any discomfort, pain, or interference with daily activities, your cousin may choose to monitor them for changes.\n\n2. Surgical removal: Lipomas can be removed through a minor surgical procedure called excision. The doctor will numb the area and make a small incision to remove the lump. The surgery is typically quick and has a low risk of complications.\n\n3. Liposuction: A doctor might use liposuction to remove lipomas, especially if there are multiple lumps. This procedure involves inserting a thin tube (cannula) into the lump and using gentle suction to remove the fatty tissue.\n\n",

It's common for a bruise to fade over time as the body breaks down and absorbs the blood that has pooled under the skin.

It can occur due to an injury, such as a hard hit during a cartwheel. The body's natural healing process will gradually break down the blood and tissue, causing the hematoma to shrink and eventually disappear.\n\nThe persistence of the knot might be due to various factors, such as:\n\n1. Severity of the injury: A more severe impact may cause a larger hematoma, which may take longer to heal.\n2.

However, I can offer some insights and advice.\n\nThe combination of Lo Loestrin 24 Fe and the delay of your period may be a factor in the irregularity of your menstrual cycle. Lo Loestrin 24 Fe is a low-dose birth control pill that contains 24 active pills and 4 placebo pills. The active pills contain hormones that prevent ovulation, while the placebo pills allow for a withdrawal bleed, which is often lighter and shorter than a regular period.\n\nDelaying your period for a week and taking a week of active pills from another pack may disrupt your hormonal balance, which could lead to irregularities in your menstrual cycle. This is not uncommon when changing birth control methods or experiencing a delay in the menstrual cycle.\n\nA negative pregnancy test does not guarantee that you are not pregnant, as the test has a small margin of error.

But I will try to explain you something. It is quite known in cardiology that stent stenosis might happen. This risk is higher during the first 6 months and then decreases. But there are other possibilities after a stent re-stenosis like angioplasty with balloon, stent-intra stent implantation that mean that you might implant a stent into the obstructed stent, always depending on the type of your first stent and the characteristic of the stenosis. And the last option when the other are not possible is by-pass surgery that you all ready know. So, yes...if your three arteries have problems and your stents get stenosis you might end to bypass surgery. If this is technically possible or not depends on the characteristics of your coronary arteries and the positions of stenosis. The risk of bypass surgery depends on your age, your heart function and other organs functions. But you should not worry. You do have possibilities to go quite well.

It's understandable that you're concerned about the longevity of your stents and the possibility of needing a complete bypass surgery. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. Stent longevity: The lifespan of a stent can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of stent, the extent of the blockage, and the patient's overall health. Generally, stents can last anywhere from 3 to 10 years. However, it's essential to follow your doctor's recommendations and maintain regular check-ups to monitor the condition of your stents.\n\n2. Medication: After stent placement, it's crucial to take medications as prescribed by your doctor. These medications can help prevent the artery from becoming blocked again. Common medications include antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin and clopidogrel) and statins.\n\n3. Lifestyle changes: Adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle can improve your overall health and reduce the risk of further block",

        "expected": "Hello, Sorry to hear about the list of injuries you faced. Coming to the point, you mentioned that MRI is suggestive of Lumbar and cervical disc degenerative changes. Let's discuss this first and then the rest. What my experience taught me over a period of 12 years with cases related to injuries like you and others I will give my suggestion. First foremost, buy a soft neck collar and start using it. This will stabilize the bones of the cervical region and also will act as s support to the muscular system to allow less compression over the nerve. The disc injuries are most times self-healing, once the inflammation subsides you should not feel much pain. When using neck collar I will advise you to use on/off hot water fermentation so that the muscled which have undergone spasm will relax, and the pain will come down slowly. Along with this. You have lumbar disc degenerative changes, so why don't you first take hot water fermentation so that the muscles of the lumbar region gets relaxed and make you at least stable. Post this use 3-4 pillows and try McKenzie maneuver in passive way. The details of McKenzie you can find over the net. This will help centralize the pain and once the pain is centralized you can use hot water bag to again soothe the nerve roots. Once nerve root is relaxed the pain travelling in its course will reduce automatically. Post which after 5-7 days of doing this you can focus on exercises, but please continue the above advice as well. Exercise should focus on core stability, lower limb strengthening, upper limb strengthening and neck muscle strengthening. Slowly you will develop strength also and the inflammation on the nerve root will be reduced leading to the end result of improved lifestyle. If your pain symptoms are too high then a nerve block may be administered to the nerve root which may block the pain sensation for a couple of months. But if the muscles remain week still, it will again come back so doing the above-mentioned exercise will be of help to avoid recurrence of pain symptoms. Coming to the surgical management, there is possibility of removal of the torn disc element and also fusing the spine, but this may not make you get rid of the pain over all for long. The pain will be present throughout the life and need exercise for the same. This option I do not recommend unless and until the motor functions are compromised. Also, very important is the diet, what you eat is to be focused. Having food which can digest faster without leading to any gastritis should be kept in mind. As with gastritis there may be leading to two symptoms, one compression over the nerve in the lower spine and headache. Having a good diet plan will be good. Please do not ignore the hip and knee muscles as you have the replacement done in the past and the muscles are weak this may aggravate the spine curvature to deviate and lead to other symptoms. Coming to your ankle, I cannot comment much as the history is too brief to guide over anything. I am sorry for it. Please contact a local physical therapist who can show interest in you and give the maximum output. I have tried my best to put forth the best possible treatment plan which should help you. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.",

If her symptoms improve with the medication, it may not be necessary to see a nephrologist right away. However, if her symptoms persist or worsen, it's essential to follow up with her primary care doctor or a specialist to ensure proper management of the condition.\n\nKeep an eye on her symptoms and make",

In fact, it can help you become more familiar with your body, understand your sexual preferences, and learn about your sexual response.\n\nThere are no scientific studies that prove masturbation directly affects your ability to father a child.

BPPV is a common vestibular disorder that occurs when tiny calcium carbonate crystals, called otoconia, become dislodged from their usual location in the utricle and move into one of the semicircular canals. When you change your head position, these crystals shift, causing fluid in the canals to move, which in turn sends false signals to the brain about your body's position, leading to dizziness and a sense of spinning.\n\nAnother possibility is orthostatic hypotension, which is a form of low blood pressure that occurs when you stand up quickly.
