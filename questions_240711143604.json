It started with long coughing fits in the day and these have reduced but have been added to by coughing fits at night which feel like they go on for ever. Also during these I cannot breathe in which initially caused me to panic but I found I could breathe in if I calmed down but this took some time. Chemist gave me a Ventolin inhaler to open airways during attack which helped a bit. Also I have an almost constant tickling sensation in the back of my throat and at night for the last week my chest has felt tight - ventolin inhaler has helped relieve this. Finally I feel like something is stuck in the right hand side of my throat but cant normally cough it up as cough is generally unproductive, except first thing in the morning when I am able to cough up some clear phlegm but also tend to vomit as well. Occasional dry mouth at night doesnt help.

I figured the pain would present the next day in my leg or tail bone but to my surprise the pain was very mild in my leg and there was no pain in bottom at all. I noticed two days later my side was hurting with a mild to moderate pain. The pain is located exactly in a certain spot up under my rib cage on my right side.

        "context": "hI, I have no question for you. Just an attitude as to how pain management is being, or should I say not being done. Because of a handful of people who CHOOSE TO Abuse drugs, who really gets punished? Spinal Stenosis and 2 back surgeries, the last the titanium rods, plates, and screws were inserted from L2 thru L5. Stopped the pain for about 2 years, or at least at a tolerable level. Then Lortabs helped. Sent to pain clinic for epidurals. Epidurals on me were extremely painful. Scale of 1-10 they were a 20. (Not Kidding) Quality of life was going fast. couldn t do or go because the pain had grown to the point that I couldn t eat or sleep. Pain was 24 hours a day. Told by the pain Dr. to stay on the Lortab and come to the pain clinic every 4 or 5 weeks for epidurals. Epidurals were not only painful but I got very little relief if any from them. Finally PCP started me on oxycontin and Fentynal patch. I was much better for awile. I was taught that in so called pain management you would gradually increase dose until you knew the patient was experiencing some quality of life. I reached rock bottom after telling PCP my quality of life was slipping away. Finally I asked for an increase in pain med as pain was now 24 hours a day. I could not function. I was told no, and referred to pain clinic for more epidurals and Narcotics. The day I went in to office for routine followup and new perscriptions I was ask for a urine specimen. After all I d been thru over the last 8 to 10 years, all the operations and all the pain. The loss of any quality of life. I am in my 70 s and lost all those Golden years, 10 of them. Asking for a urine specimen. I felt made ME the criminal. I decided right then I asked to be titrated off the narcotic meds. I will die with all the pain before I will let anyone treat me like a criminal. So you go on breaking your solom oath by hurting patients . Doctors swore to do no harm. A large % of those being hurt and are suffuring are the geriatric population. I feel Obama has been behind a lot of this but you know I believe a lot of the fault falls on every Doctor, Nurse, and everyone working in health care. STAND UP FOR YOUR PATIENTS. yOU ALL ARE JUST LIKE THE POLITICIANS. tO SAVE THEIR OWN HIDES THEY JUST CLOSE THEIR EYES TO WHAT IS HAPPINING TO MEDICINE IN THIS COUNTRY AND SAY NOTHING. tHE PUBLIC CAN T EVEN GET TOGETHER AND STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT. The old time Doctor s predicted It would be like this. They said if the HMO went through it would be the death of our wonderful medical care in this country. Many have passed but they were right on. They realized that there would not be anymore decent medical care. The patient is really obsolete. No more real check ups. no more time to explain your problem. No more real examinations Oh, there is on paper or in the computer so health care workers, even Doctors just make sure they cover their butts, to the point of out right lying!!! Make it look like things were done just to collect the fees. The lawyers are partially to blame also with their ambulance chasing and advertising for frivolous malpractice suits. Rep. and Dems. just sit on their hands. Political correctness has run amuck. I thoroughly loved working in the medical world at one time. Now I want nothing to do with it Extreme pain is killing me literally but I will die with it. Think back of all the pain meds that really did relieve pain. Where are they now. Listed as a narcotic, now even lortab now and it is only hurting those who really need it. The really sick. But their pain med prescription has to be picked up at dr s. office no matter if they can hardly get out of bed. No husband or designated relative or person can pick it up. Can t even be called into the pharmacy anymore. What do they think they are doing. I am done with a medical world that has turned into nothing but a money making machine. Worst of all the money flows to the very few at the top while staffs are cut to the bone. Doctors are told what they can and can t do, how many patients they have to see in a day. no wonder there is no examining going on, No time to get to know their patients. On top of that not enougChatDoctorpensation for what they are trying to do. Trying to do the impossible. The patient is only needed for a name and insurance number. The old days were Heaven when working in the medical field if your heart was in it. Today s medical world is Hell in my eyes after all my personal experiences. A lot of us feel like we are on our own and no matter what doctor you go to we are not being treated, just pushed thru the system as fast as possible. Many, many mistakes are being made. No one, including doctors and nurses seem to know what they are doing. It is not their fault. They are not being properly taught and trained, just shoved thru school and paying exorbitant rates to do it. Something I use to love so very much has become something very ugly and I hate it. I have been on both ends. Suffering terribly and hanging out here on my own but so grateful to God for giving me the privilege of working in the world of medicine during the years before it fell.",

One day more than a week ago I believe I sat too long on a bicycle with a very hard seat and after I started feeling a bit pain on the tailbone area.

But 2 days ago I was in a lot of pain and when I checked it out in the mirror I saw that I had a bump on the right cheek of the butt (above the anus, near the tailbone area). Its not much red or irritated but it seems swollen and like the size of an almond and it does not look like it has created pus. Yesterday I started using Advil for the pain and it was effective, then the pharmacist gave me Eudorlin which I tried but it had no effect whatsoever for the pain. So today after a night with no sleep I went back to Advil. I m really nervous cause I can barely walk, I can t sit, and I m not at all comfortable laying down, (so I m not getting much sleep ).

        "context": "Dear Doctor, Alcohol, Atrial Fibrillation & Life after... I get blotted, noxious after drinking only one glass of white wine. Although I do not drink much, I ve had a couple episodes of atrial fibrillation in the past 2 to 3 years. These episodes were serious enough for me to be kept in the ICU of the hospitals I went to. Both lasted for 48 hours+ followed by a couple of days of watch time. Ever since the second episodes, I was prescribed to take Rytmonorm 150 coupled with Coraspin 300 to avoid any blood clots. After 2 years on the treatment, I ve hoped that my heart would be clear of the problem and tried to get off of the medicine. Within 24 hours, my heart started to beat erratically, enough so that I immediately reached for the pills... Along with my heart beating awkwardly, I ve noticed an almost instant pain in my head coupled with a slight but persistent confusion... I have repeatedly told about the combination of effects to a few doctors only to be dismissed at once as there doesn t seem to be any correlation with the heart/brain (as per the doc s opinions)... I have gotten a check-up with my cardiologist a couple of weeks ago and he recommends that I stay on the medication (one of my valve (top?) is 4cm wide whereas it should be at maximum 3.8cm (from memory, and I can t remember what was what exactly). Also, there was another measure from the ECG of 450ms or such between beat... Where it should stay under 450 or 430... Again, I do not recall the exact lingo... My question is simple. Are there any known adverse effect to taking a medication such as Rytmonorm, does it affect the initial problem (atrial fibrillation)? Is there any way to remedy the problem without resorting to ablation (which has a low success rate) or cut through the electrical system (old style)... I really would like to get off the medication. Thank you for your time and feedback on this case. Best Regards, Frederic",

I had MRI last week of my brain and I was completely fine. After today s attempt at getting the spine MRI, I went to my car to leave and I ended up vomiting. I ve felt nauseated all day and now I m burning up with fever. Should I be worried? If I m still feverish tomorrow, should I see a Dr.? Thank you for your advice",

        "context": "Hi doctor, hope you can help me with this. Yesterday morning (about 28 hours ago), I woke up with a morning erection, then decided to masturbate, even though my bladder must have been quite full, or at least half full. I usually masturbate after I have been to the toilet. The masturbation was quite short lasting, lying on my back, quite gentle masturbation, not rough, but at the ejaculation point, it didn t feel very good, a little painful during, which I haven t experienced before. I think it must have been related to the bladder not being emptied first. A few minutes later, I possibly made a second mistake, by urinating. It did seem like the urethrea was not ready for urine yet, took a while to succeed. Is it advised to wait a while before one urinates? Then during the day and night I have felt rather uncomfortable, mostly during the night, some pain/discomfort, which feels like it is located at the point where I usually feel if I need to urinate or not. Is this bladder pain? It helps a bit to urinate though. Could I have had some urine in the urethrea accidentally mixed together with the sperm during ejaculation? And is this harmful? I also wanna mention that the night before this I ate two oranges and quite much chocolate, which could make the urine more acid and harmful? I have not had sex for a long time, and never unprotected, so STD is out of the question. Now I am taking some ibuprofen and also some cranberry capsules. Not sure if I should see a doctor yet, since this is so fresh. I have a tendency to see doctor too often and worry about health matters. Could you please shed light to what might have happened? Does it sound like a temporary problem? Or will I next time also feel discomfort during ejaculation? I haven t tried masturbating again, since I think I should rest the system for some days.",

        "context": "Hello, I am 40, male, non-smoker, 6ft tall and weighing 194lbs. I ve been losing weight for the past 5 months. In March I went to my cardiologist to have my heart checked. Since then I am on Lisinopril 20mg to control my bloodpressure. All the tests were fine. At the time of my doctors visit I was weighing 230lbs. So I dropped around 36 pounds in 5 months. Is that normal? Also, it doesn t stop. I keep losing weight. I changed my diet a little bit, but nothing radical though. Less soft drinks and deep fried food, other than that I have decent lunch and dinner. I don t have any pain or loss of appetite. My bowel movement is normal and stool color is light-brown to brown. Could Lisinopril be the cause of my weight loss? Also, I have anxiety and get very nervous with the slidest pain. Could anxiety also be a cause? Your thoughts and comments are more than welcome. Many thanks Michael",

In the past year I have changed my lifestyle and have lost over 50 lbs. In the fall of 1994 my L4-5 disc bulged/hernitated and it also affected my right side sciatic nerve. After a hospital stay and 6 months of physio my back was not getting any better. I eventually had to have surgery. I had a discetomy and the L4-4 level and a limited laminectomy posteriorly at this operative site as well. My back seemed better for a few years then started to act up again. In 2002 I had an MRI done and the diagnosis stated theat there was a generalized bulging of the reamaining intervertebral disc at the L4-5 level without evidence of focality. Also, it stated that at the L4-5 level the posterior facet joints demonstrate very early mild symmetric degenerative change. Again, I took things easy, had physio and things seemed to be ok. Fast forward to 2011 and again I am in pain and limited mobility. My days are the worse in the mornings and in the evenings. I purchased a great bed 6 months ago because of my back problems. I have low back pressure and pain, as well as pain in my right buttock with pain radiating down my right leg. It is hard to perform any tasks below my waist ie tying up my shoe laces, picking up dropped items, washing in feet etc. Could yoy tell me a what my prognosis may be and what I may be looking forward to.

Could it be Lyme s even though my last blood test came back negative? I know the blood test is not all that accurate. Should I ask for a Western Blot test to be taken?",

She has an extreme ulcer that she has been dealing with for a year. Original biopsy of ulcer came back negative. They are doing another endoscopy this week with ultrasound and deeper biopsy. She has lost over 60lbs this year and severe muscle mass. Nobody will give her an answer or outlook. Everything I m reading online states that malignant ascites has a bad prognosis. But why doesn t anything show up on a PET scan?",

        "context": "I started the pill yaz flex in october/november 2013 and got some breakthrough bleeding during the first or second month using it so i just took the 4 day break and everything was fine. 3 weeks ago I went overseas and the plane trips in total equaled about 25 hours. I had sex a few times but my boyfriend pulled out before he did anything and most of the time we used condoms. Then i got my period and it has lasted about 2 weeks and during this time we had sex but again he pulled out. The bleeding has ranged from heavy and red to light and brown.. Now that I am back home I have started the 4 day break and it has been 2 days and i still only have brown discharge. Is it quite unlikely that I could be pregnant due to the fact i took the pill correctly (usually on time but if not only about an hour late) and that he never came inside me? Ive read that the 2 weeks of bleeding can be due to hormones changing from change of lifestyle and things (like being overseas) and also that the body is getting used to the pill, is this correct?

The first time, doctor diagnosed me with a UTI, but wasnt sure if it could also be a yeast infection.  So, she prescribed Bacterim for 5 days but it gave me diahhrea so Dr. changed it to Cipro, which worked fine.  She also gave me a one time pill to take for the yeast infection after finishing the Cipro.  I took all my medication.  During treatment, I saw a little spotting of watered down blood after wiping my pee pee.  Dr. took another urine exam.  Said I never had UTI but that I definitely had a yeast infection.  I finished all my meds so I waited to see if I would be okay and it seemed as though I was.  Yesterday, when I went pee pee, I wiped and saw some more watered down red spots on the tissue.  I returned to the Dr. today who ordered a urinalysis.  He is having me worked up for bladder or kidney cancer just as a precaution. Still dont know what is causing the sporadic blood spots.

I do not have blood pressure or diabetes or any other health problems. Pregnancy went normal without any events. On 5th I did scan and babies weight was 3.0. Doctor asked us to take c-section date and we choose 14th june. Tuesday on 8th, I was feeling extremely tired and had cramps in my legs. I also was feeling less baby movements. I went to doctor and they checked heartbeats. It was 148. So, they told us baby is fine and come for final checkup on 11th. I went on 11th and doctor couldnt find babies heartbeats. What could be the reason for this? I had to take out still born child immediately with second c-section. Is it okay to try conceiving for second baby now? I had one cycle of my menstrual period in August. What kind of care should I take and what are the chances of getting similar even repeated? Doctor told me that there was blood clot in umbilical cord and so babies heartbeat stopped suddenly.Cheers,Shweta",

Especially after drinking alcohol at weekends. Or using e-cigarettes which I have been smoking (instead of normal cigarettes) since almost a year. Chewing ginger helps a lot, but I am still concerned. Could both dentists miss some other gum problems? Herpes, sdts or else?
