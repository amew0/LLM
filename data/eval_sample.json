Since you have not mentioned the age of the patient or the actual diagnosis your cardiologist has given, it would be wrong to give a definite idea about the scope of Homeopathy in this case. However, there are some wonderful remedies in Homeopathy for heart failure and arrhythmias. I would recommend you to submit a complete case record with reports and then a call can be taken about treatment. You can mail the reports at Chat Doctor. Com if you would like further guidance.

My bloating looks like im 2-3 months pregnant.  No changes in my eating habits.  Could the bloating be related to ovarian cancer? or a cyst? No adominal or back pain. or abnormal bleeding. I am 29. I am now weighing in at 112 (104 previously) 5 feet 2.  Thanks!",
        "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Bloating is a non-specific symptom and might be seen in many conditions. Cysts in the ovary might cause bloating sensation and this requires clinical abdominal examination and ultrasound scan or CT scan. Any cyst in the ovary will be noted. It is also possible that there might be a condition in the uterus and this might be confirmed by clinical investigations. A pap smear is not connected to cyst in ovary. It tells about the cells in cervix. Please discuss your pap smear report with the doctor. If there is any cyst in the ovary then you might have to do additional test like CA 125 to know if there is any risk of cancer associated with the cyst. You might also get your thyroid function test done. Please do not worry.",
